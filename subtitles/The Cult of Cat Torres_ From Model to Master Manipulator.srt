1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,419
Okay, let's dive in.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:07,400
We're unpacking a story today that feels like it could, well, it could only really happen

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,660
in the age of online influence.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,480
It really does.

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,820
Our source material is a detailed YouTube transcript.

6
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:19,079
It chronicles the life of Kat Torres from her challenging beginnings to becoming

7
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:25,519
this viral online personality, life coach, spiritual guru, and then ultimately facing

8
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,000
some really serious allegations.

9
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:27,800
That's right.

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,280
The sources you shared, they allow this whole narrative that starts with like overcoming

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,100
hardship, building this huge online following, projecting this super luxurious lifestyle.

12
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:42,500
And then it shifts pretty dramatically to these deeply disturbing claims, manipulation, exploitation,

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,920
even human trafficking, made by people really close to her.

14
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,799
So our mission here in this deep dive is to basically go through this source material,

15
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:53,820
try to understand the narrative it presents, look at the tactics that we're allegedly

16
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,579
used, explore the reported ripple effects on our followers, and just think about the

17
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:01,659
bigger picture, you know, the implications of online influence.

18
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,939
And it's crucial everything we discuss comes only from the sources you've provided.

19
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,640
We're sticking just to that.

20
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:08,219
Exactly.

21
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:09,700
Just the source material.

22
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:14,819
It's a story that takes us from, well, what looks like ambition and resilience to

23
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:17,620
something much, much darker, allegedly.

24
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:18,439
Absolutely.

25
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:21,780
So where did the sources say her story really begins?

26
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,099
What was her background like?

27
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:29,579
Okay, so the sources tell us Cat Torres, born in Balem, Brazil, back in 1992, grew up in

28
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:34,140
poverty, apparently had an alcoholic father, so, you know, a really tough start.

29
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,400
Yeah, sounds like it.

30
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,599
But despite that, her looks got noticed early on.

31
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,260
Right.

32
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,900
She got into modeling, beauty pageants, starting when she was just what, 12?

33
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:44,180
Yeah, 12 years old.

34
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:49,439
And even in that world, the sources mentioned she experienced assault by men involved

35
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,200
in the pageants.

36
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:50,780
Oh, wow.

37
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:54,939
And they note that this reportedly shaped her leader life pretty significantly.

38
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,319
It's clear she was determined, though.

39
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:02,859
She pushed through that achieved some early success, won the Miss Kyer's Walk, got signed

40
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:03,719
with elite modeling.

41
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:03,939
Right.

42
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,299
Traveled in Europe the whole thing.

43
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,519
And then she got a big dose of public attention.

44
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,520
The sources mentioned her being spotted with Leonardo DiCaprio.

45
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:14,539
Uh, yes, that story.

46
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,120
Now Cat never confirmed it.

47
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:17,259
He denied it later.

48
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:19,259
But the sources are pretty clear.

49
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,599
That moment definitely boosted her fame.

50
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:26,120
You could see, or the sources suggest you could see, a real hunger for stardom there.

51
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,800
And this is where the sources show her making a conscious shift, right?

52
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,099
Moving to America, changing careers.

53
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:32,680
Exactly.

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,539
Leveraging that modeling fame to sort of rebrand herself as a businesswoman, an

55
00:02:38,539 --> 00:02:39,000
influencer.

56
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,659
She was already kind of known on social media.

57
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:44,659
And she built on it by sharing personal stuff.

58
00:02:44,659 --> 00:02:47,520
Her routine, fitness, self-improvement.

59
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,680
The sources say this felt really relatable, very authentic to people.

60
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,800
And that perceived authenticity, well, it's gold online, isn't it?

61
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:54,039
Totally.

62
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:55,199
It really worked for her.

63
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,280
Built her Instagram to over a million followers.

64
00:02:57,659 --> 00:02:59,199
The sources call them die-hard fans.

65
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,219
And she pivots again.

66
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,400
Becomes a life coach.

67
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:01,860
Right.

68
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,759
And the message was powerful because it was simple, tied to her story.

69
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:08,020
If I can do it, so can you.

70
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,280
Which, you know, if you bought into the online persona, seemed pretty credible.

71
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,199
She offered courses, dating advice, one-on-one coaching.

72
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:17,900
Yeah, the sources say up to $700 a session.

73
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:18,439
OK.

74
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:24,520
But this rapid rise, this online success, it started raising questions, according

75
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,259
to the sources, especially around her wealth.

76
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,840
The lifestyle she was showing up.

77
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:29,319
Exactly.

78
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:36,000
Super extravagant, luxury vacations, this huge NYC apartment, views of the Hudson, Statue

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,979
of Liberty, the works.

80
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:41,199
And the sources specifically ask, you know, could her modeling savings really fund

81
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:41,639
all that?

82
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,259
There was speculation brewing.

83
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:43,919
Yeah.

84
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,340
And her former roommate, Luzer Torsky, he's quoted in the sources, said he wasn't

85
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,879
paying for their flat and he didn't think Kat was either.

86
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:54,159
He even described picking up an envelope stuffed with cash for her.

87
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:54,580
Right.

88
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:58,560
So the sources flip this idea that maybe she wasn't quite the self-made

89
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,379
woman she claimed.

90
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:02,139
They mentioned speculation she was a sugar baby.

91
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:04,319
And that rumored Russian oligarch, A.

92
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:09,639
Yeah, A. Allegedly funding her lifestyle, supposed connections to Putin, gifts

93
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:10,639
like a diamond Rolex.

94
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,960
It definitely clashes with the image she's sold to her followers and coaching

95
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,400
clients.

96
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,000
It's a pretty big discrepancy, the sources point out, suggests that core

97
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,100
message might have been, well, built on shaky ground.

98
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:26,139
And then things take another major turn, according to the sources, a health crisis.

99
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:27,240
Yeah, this is huge.

100
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:32,019
She comes back from Brazil, contracts a flesh-eating disease, really serious

101
00:04:32,019 --> 00:04:32,500
stuff.

102
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,860
Required removing implants, eventually her left breast.

103
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:39,600
And she documented this whole ordeal intensely on social media.

104
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,279
But the sources suggest that this health crisis, the physical changes,

105
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,139
maybe led to losing those rich suitors.

106
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:51,199
Including the alleged Russian boyfriend, she reportedly felt abandoned.

107
00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:53,279
Yeah, that's what the sources say.

108
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,899
And that feeling of vulnerability, it seems like that was a catalyst for,

109
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,680
well, a new direction.

110
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,660
Superiority.

111
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:01,500
Specifically, ayahuasca.

112
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:01,740
Okay.

113
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,459
But the sources are specific.

114
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,980
They say after these ayahuasca experiences, she flipped, started

115
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,079
going off the deep end.

116
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:14,019
And this is when she started claiming the spiritual gift, the voice.

117
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,899
Yes, according to her, or according to the sources reporting on her,

118
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:20,759
this voice gave her insights, predicted the future.

119
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,899
Which is what shifted her from life coach to, like, spiritual guru territory.

120
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,920
And the sources immediately kind of posed the question,

121
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,879
was this a real spiritual awakening?

122
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,220
Or were these, and they used the phrase, troubling delusions?

123
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:37,779
The sources also mentioned some key influences around this time.

124
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:40,240
Yeah, like the Brazilian psychic, John of God.

125
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:42,560
Who was later convicted of sexual assault.

126
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,339
Right, and also Tony Robbins.

127
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,480
Kat's husband apparently said she dragged him to their events.

128
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,319
They also spent time back in Brazil exploring different religious practices.

129
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,019
The sources describe it as her looking for an answer.

130
00:05:55,339 --> 00:05:58,100
Becoming really deeply invested in spiritualism,

131
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,779
which apparently caused a lot of strain in her marriage to Colburn.

132
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,360
She even wrote a book, didn't she?

133
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:04,560
The Voice.

134
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,160
Yeah, claiming the whole thing came to her in a trance.

135
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,220
And the sources detail some of the stuff she said she was getting from The Voice,

136
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,519
hearing messages from other planets.

137
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,060
Uh-huh.

138
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:17,600
Information, civilization isn't prepared for, talk about death.

139
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:22,100
Again, the sources really frame these as potentially troubling delusions.

140
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,560
And this seems to be where the sources indicate the alleged harm really starts to surface.

141
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:31,540
Her behavior reportedly got aggressive, hostile.

142
00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:33,660
Straining the marriage with Colburn even more.

143
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:34,779
And then there's Anna.

144
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:39,000
Right, the sources describe Kat persuading Anna, who was a client from Boston,

145
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,000
to move in with her in New York.

146
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:43,019
And the offer sounded like a real job, right?

147
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,480
$2,000 a month.

148
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:48,439
Yeah, to care for pets, cook, do laundry, seem straightforward.

149
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,740
But the reality, according to the sources,

150
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:53,060
totally different from the online image.

151
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,000
The house was apparently a mess.

152
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,120
Kat peed on the sofas.

153
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:58,860
That's what Anna reportedly said.

154
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,980
And described Kat herself as strange.

155
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,220
And demanding constant companionship.

156
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,600
Even in the shower.

157
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:05,500
Apparently so.

158
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:08,839
Anna described trying to get sleep by, like pretending to go to the gym,

159
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,459
but actually just sleeping on a yoga mat somewhere else in the building.

160
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,860
Saying she was afraid Kat would come after me,

161
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,279
as she just tried to sleep in her room.

162
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:16,779
That's intense.

163
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:18,060
And the kicker.

164
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:20,100
The sources say Anna was never actually paid.

165
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:20,759
Never paid.

166
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:21,259
Nope.

167
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:24,740
And when she asked for the money, Kat allegedly got aggressive

168
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,939
and apparently brought up some really dark,

169
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,420
traumatic memories of domestic violence for Anna.

170
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:31,100
Just awful stuff.

171
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:31,939
Wow.

172
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:35,000
So Anna managed to get out after three months.

173
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,279
Yeah, but it reportedly took her over a year to fully cut off communication.

174
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:42,600
The sources really point to Kat's alleged control tactics

175
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,360
making it hard to break free.

176
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:47,279
Meanwhile, back with the husband, Coburn,

177
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,980
before he could file for divorce, Kat just vanished.

178
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,959
Seemingly, he ended up hiring a PI to find her.

179
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,199
And the sources say that in 2022,

180
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,720
Kat, who was 30 by then, moved to Texas

181
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,740
with a new husband, Zach, who was only 21.

182
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,079
Yeah, quite an age gap there.

183
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,779
They move into this big five-bedroom house.

184
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,459
And this is where the sources introduced the witch clan.

185
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:09,000
Right.

186
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,899
Kat allegedly reaches out to loyal Brazilian followers online,

187
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,920
says she's having a mental health crisis,

188
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,680
needs them to come join her in Texas.

189
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,040
And the offer she made them.

190
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,079
Sounded amazing according to the sources,

191
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,060
personal access to the voice, free rent,

192
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:26,300
paid flights, and $2,000 a month salary.

193
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,339
So the sources name three women who took her up on it.

194
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,700
Leticia, Desiree, and someone called Soul.

195
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,179
Yeah, Soul is an alias.

196
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:37,120
The sources describe them as vulnerable women

197
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,980
who trusted Kat, saw it as a huge opportunity.

198
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,559
Desiree, for instance, apparently believed

199
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,179
Kat had healed her migraines.

200
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:44,519
OK.

201
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,340
And she asked Kat for advice about her marriage problems.

202
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,320
Kat allegedly told her to just leave her husband

203
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,460
and come work with her instead.

204
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,259
And Kat called them her witch clan.

205
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,379
That's the term the sources use.

206
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:58,360
Apparently Kat got heavily into witchcraft around this time,

207
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:00,500
had a dedicated room, an altar.

208
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,360
Used for spiritual advice based on what she said

209
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,340
or what the voice said.

210
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:04,720
Exactly.

211
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,000
And a chilling example the sources give.

212
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,460
Desiree was reportedly told by the voice

213
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,179
to go find her husband at a strip club.

214
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:12,759
What?

215
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,360
Yeah.

216
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,799
So she went and then she started working there herself

217
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,899
using the name Chanel.

218
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:20,980
And the sources emphasize these women allegedly

219
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:24,480
followed Kat's orders, like whether they wanted to or not.

220
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,019
That's the picture painted, yes.

221
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,639
OK, let's dig into that Texas house situation more.

222
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,580
The sources describe some really disturbing stuff

223
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,259
about exploitation and control.

224
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:35,779
Yeah, it gets pretty dark.

225
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:38,080
The sources detail major financial control.

226
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:41,299
Kat paid for their flights, housing, food, sure.

227
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:43,500
But allegedly insisted they couldn't leave

228
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,320
until they paid her back every penny.

229
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:48,220
Reportedly even threatened to curse them if they tried.

230
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,000
Wow.

231
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,419
And there was a hierarchy.

232
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,179
Oh yeah.

233
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:55,600
Kat at the top, the queen, sometimes even Mother Mary.

234
00:09:56,259 --> 00:09:58,240
Zack, the young husband, was like, God.

235
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,580
And the women at the very bottom.

236
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:01,759
And any money the women earned.

237
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,139
Allegedly went straight to Kat, all of it.

238
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,960
Including everything Desiree made working at the strip club.

239
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,580
And Kat said income targets.

240
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,600
Dealing targets, yeah.

241
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,120
Started at $1,000 a day, then apparently went even higher.

242
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,519
How did she justify this?

243
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,320
The sources say she claimed she couldn't work

244
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,559
because of her health issues.

245
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:21,860
And Zack needed to stay home to focus on his MMA training.

246
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:22,740
MMA training.

247
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,620
Apparently the voice predicted he'd make millions.

248
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,720
And Desiree was reportedly paying for his trainer too.

249
00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:29,440
Unbelievable.

250
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:33,639
And the sources say Kat set up online profiles for them.

251
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,659
Seating profiles, yeah.

252
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,600
Including on Sugar Baby and escort sites

253
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,240
for Desiree and Letitia.

254
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,960
And raised Desiree's target to $3,000 a day.

255
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,500
That's what the sources claim.

256
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:44,940
And if she didn't make it,

257
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,399
forced to sleep outside, allegedly.

258
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:50,419
Plus threats of calling the police if they didn't comply.

259
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,360
This level of control, it's staggering.

260
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:54,980
The law of silence.

261
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,720
Yeah, the sources describe that too.

262
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,460
Women reportedly forbidden from speaking to each other,

263
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,840
couldn't even leave their rooms,

264
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,980
not even for the bathroom without Kat's permission.

265
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,580
This sounds like psychological torture.

266
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:07,340
And the sources say the coaching they received shifted.

267
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:09,779
Started normalizing sex work, SW.

268
00:11:10,299 --> 00:11:10,840
How so?

269
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,379
Kat reportedly tried to tempt Desiree,

270
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,820
comparing how much she could earn.

271
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,639
And Sol, the other woman, overheard Kat,

272
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,820
allegedly telling a client that she herself

273
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,720
was punished by the voice to be an SW in Brazil.

274
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:24,399
Okay, hearing that conversation,

275
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,419
that's what pushed Sol to escape.

276
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,919
That's what the sources indicate, yeah.

277
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:30,179
She overheard that and started planning.

278
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:32,299
Managed to get out after 42 days,

279
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,080
apparently with help from an ex-boyfriend.

280
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:35,100
But she was still scared.

281
00:11:35,539 --> 00:11:37,480
Terrified, the sources emphasize.

282
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:39,980
Because Kat allegedly had their documents,

283
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:42,659
passports, birth certificates, everything.

284
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:44,720
And Zak was known to be well-armed,

285
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:46,799
reportedly talked about it openly.

286
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:49,100
So Desiree, she was still there.

287
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:51,700
And she eventually agreed to start SW.

288
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:52,200
Yes.

289
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,000
The sources reference her book,

290
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:56,299
Searching Desiree, where she talks about it.

291
00:11:56,659 --> 00:11:58,860
Her first time charging $1,000.

292
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,620
And the fear she lived with.

293
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,960
Constant fear, she reportedly described.

294
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,559
Fear of arrest, immigration problems even being killed,

295
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,200
said she'd scrub herself raw after encounters.

296
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,019
And all that money, straight to Kat.

297
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:14,100
Every cent, according to the sources.

298
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:15,500
And the sources mentioned something

299
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,600
about their appearance changing.

300
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,419
Yeah, a really striking detail.

301
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,159
Kat reportedly dyed the women's hair blonde.

302
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,840
Desiree started wearing contacts.

303
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:24,620
The sources suggest it was like

304
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,960
she was turning them into her clones.

305
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:26,679
Wow.

306
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:28,159
Okay, so this whole situation,

307
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:30,059
it eventually breaks into public view, right?

308
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,139
April 2022.

309
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:32,100
Exactly.

310
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,879
The sources say Kat went online

311
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:36,620
and launched this just vicious public attack

312
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,220
on her former assistant, Anna.

313
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,460
The one who escaped from New York.

314
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,419
That's the one.

315
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:42,320
Reportedly called her a traitor,

316
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,159
made a really bizarre threat about her skull placement.

317
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:45,940
That's a skull placement.

318
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:48,279
Yeah, demanded followers, tag Anna,

319
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:51,379
called her a slave, just completely unhinged stuff,

320
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,419
according to the sources.

321
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,659
And that online outburst

322
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:56,700
is what finally got police attention,

323
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:00,080
or at least prompted Anna and Sol to file reports.

324
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,299
Yes, although the sources say initially

325
00:13:02,299 --> 00:13:04,440
the police didn't take the reports that seriously.

326
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,240
But then things escalated in Brazil.

327
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:06,980
Massively.

328
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,720
September 2022, the families of Desiree and Letitia

329
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,539
back in Brazil file missing persons reports.

330
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,580
They'd lost all contact.

331
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,419
And that blew up in the media there?

332
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:20,000
Huge coverage in Brazil, the sources say.

333
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,659
Suddenly there was widespread public concern

334
00:13:22,659 --> 00:13:23,539
about Kat Torres.

335
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:26,039
And another alleged victim came forward then too,

336
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,639
about being scammed.

337
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,340
Yeah, sources mentioned someone else

338
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,320
claiming they were scammed out of a lot of money.

339
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,820
While all this is happening, Kat's on vacation,

340
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:35,799
defending herself online.

341
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:36,539
Apparently.

342
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,340
And then Desiree and Letitia post these videos.

343
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,179
The ones where they say they want to be there?

344
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:44,360
Yeah, claiming they wanted to live with Kat,

345
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:45,980
basically turning against their families

346
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,200
to show loyalty to Kat.

347
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:49,659
Although Letitia later reportedly took back

348
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:51,799
the things she said about her father in those videos.

349
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,600
But people watching saw red flags.

350
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,240
Big time, according to the sources.

351
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,419
The women talked about Kat like she was some kind of god

352
00:13:59,419 --> 00:14:03,059
capable of saving the world, mentioning Zuckerberg, Putin.

353
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,340
In disconnected phrases.

354
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,879
That's how the sources describe it.

355
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:09,019
Leading to speculation was it ayahuasca, hypnosis,

356
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,019
manipulation.

357
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:12,980
The Brazilian paper O Globo apparently said

358
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,580
they looked drugged.

359
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,879
Then external people started trying to intervene.

360
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:17,379
Yeah.

361
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,480
Like that Brazilian model Yasmin Brunette.

362
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:21,320
Yeah, she has a huge following.

363
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:23,720
She joined one of Letitia's Instagram lives,

364
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:24,700
asked her straight up,

365
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:26,919
film the room, show us you're not being threatened.

366
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:28,519
How did Letitia react?

367
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,220
Kat irritated, ended the live stream

368
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,559
pretty quick, sources say.

369
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,399
And later Desiree and Letitia

370
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:35,440
actually accused Yasmin of a crime.

371
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,620
A crime Kat was supposedly guilty of.

372
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:38,179
Exactly.

373
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,720
Yasmin filed a police complaint over it.

374
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:43,299
Letitia later reportedly explained

375
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,740
why they did it basically.

376
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,659
To show Yasmin what it felt like to be falsely accused,

377
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,059
hoping it would make people stop

378
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:50,659
calling the police on Kat.

379
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:52,519
Because the police were getting overwhelmed?

380
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:53,100
Yeah.

381
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,399
Sources indicate they were swamped with calls by them.

382
00:14:55,539 --> 00:14:55,720
Okay.

383
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:58,559
So when did the police really start taking

384
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,940
the trafficking allegations seriously?

385
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,299
The sources say it was when they found

386
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:07,059
those online escort profiles for Letitia and Desiree

387
00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:09,759
and they listed Kat's actual address in Texas.

388
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:10,779
That's pretty concrete.

389
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:11,279
Yeah.

390
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,720
And right after that,

391
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,940
the group apparently fled Texas, headed up to Maine.

392
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,500
And the stuff left behind in the Texas house?

393
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,759
Found by a neighbor, hoodoo dolls, herbs.

394
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,320
The neighbor described them as unusual,

395
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,700
mentioned some were apparently for exorcisms,

396
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,080
really weird stuff.

397
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,980
And the past victims like Anna

398
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,360
contacting the FBI, they kept pushing.

399
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:34,659
They didn't give up according to the sources.

400
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:36,720
As things heated up, Kat lashed out more,

401
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:38,340
even at her husband's father.

402
00:15:38,659 --> 00:15:40,980
Yeah, allegedly saying really disturbing things like,

403
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,820
when you die, I hope you lessen.

404
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:44,100
Just seem to be spiraling.

405
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,559
So the police finally catch up with them in Maine.

406
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:47,940
They make contact.

407
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:50,419
Call Kat while she's apparently on the road

408
00:15:50,419 --> 00:15:52,139
with Letitia and Desiree.

409
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,620
And they try to check on the girls.

410
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:55,419
Yeah, officers asking things like,

411
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,019
liking America safe and sound,

412
00:15:58,019 --> 00:15:59,779
trying to gauge the situation.

413
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,200
The sources say the girls stayed loyal during that call.

414
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,440
But there was a recording.

415
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,720
This is key according to the sources.

416
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,779
Kat was secretly recorded before that police call,

417
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:11,580
apparently threatening the girls,

418
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,840
telling them how to behave, what to say.

419
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:14,940
Okay, that changes things.

420
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:15,419
Definitely.

421
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:17,659
An officer then persuaded Kat

422
00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:20,080
to bring the girls down to the police station in Maine.

423
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,120
And the detectives noticed their behavior.

424
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,820
Yeah, they observed Letitia and Desiree

425
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,980
were extremely closed off

426
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,720
and distrusting of law enforcement.

427
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,480
The sources note this is actually common

428
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,659
in trafficking victims.

429
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:32,799
And Kat herself.

430
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,620
Reportedly very evasive.

431
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:36,700
Avoided direct answers about her job

432
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,639
or what exactly the girls did for her.

433
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:40,500
So based on everything they gathered.

434
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,460
Authorities concluded Kat was involved

435
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,000
in trafficking and exploitation.

436
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,419
The sources say they recognized

437
00:16:46,419 --> 00:16:48,120
textbook trafficking tactics.

438
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,740
Like gaining trust,

439
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,200
then isolating them financially and socially.

440
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:52,720
Exactly.

441
00:16:53,419 --> 00:16:55,840
They also found out she'd overstayed her visa.

442
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,480
Which led to her deportation.

443
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:58,659
Back to Brazil, yeah.

444
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,820
Where she was immediately arrested,

445
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,639
charged with human trafficking, slave labor,

446
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:05,160
medical fraud.

447
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,700
And the first trial focused just

448
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,019
on Desiree's allegations.

449
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:09,720
That's right.

450
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,299
While she was waiting for that verdict in 2024,

451
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,579
she gave that BBC interview from prison.

452
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,680
Yeah, and the sources detail what she said.

453
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:18,759
It's pretty revealing.

454
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,599
She claimed she was different from other inmates.

455
00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:22,480
Totally. Called it real jail

456
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,500
with real people that committed real crimes

457
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,059
mentioned people who killed like 10 people

458
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:29,259
trying to distance herself.

459
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:30,539
And she denied everything.

460
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,880
All the allegations, all the victim testimony.

461
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:35,019
Flat out denied it according to the sources.

462
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,099
Said there were so many lies she couldn't stop laughing.

463
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,740
Actually claimed she thought she'd be out in 20 days.

464
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,359
Her explanation for why the judge kept her detained.

465
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,799
Was pretty out there.

466
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,660
Claimed people said she was a problem outside.

467
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:49,660
Someone who could take the minds of the people

468
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,440
and change them.

469
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,359
Which led her to question if she was a fraud or dangerous.

470
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:57,259
Yeah, like a fake guru versus so real and dangerous.

471
00:17:57,859 --> 00:18:00,259
She reportedly even said she saw herself as a danger

472
00:18:00,259 --> 00:18:02,299
because she could change minds asking,

473
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,900
she can too, can you, can I, I hope I can.

474
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:06,339
It's bizarre.

475
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,460
And she denied the women ever lived with her.

476
00:18:08,579 --> 00:18:09,420
Denied it completely.

477
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:10,700
Said other than my dog.

478
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,799
Denied sending messages inviting them.

479
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,900
Denied the bank transfers from Desiree were paychecks.

480
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:17,480
Claimed they were for Uber rides.

481
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:17,859
Yeah.

482
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,359
Like three, four K a month in Ubers.

483
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:21,740
That was her explanation according to the sources.

484
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,539
Denied the post about Anna's skull.

485
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:26,460
Denied Anna ever worked for her or lived with her.

486
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:27,319
Denied it all.

487
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:30,000
And she called the claims of PTSD

488
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,960
from former clients absolutely ridiculous.

489
00:18:33,259 --> 00:18:34,619
Said they should run back to their parents.

490
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:37,160
Claimed her advice was perfect.

491
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,380
That she was born with all talents.

492
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,940
Just zero self-awareness apparent in the interview

493
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,099
based on the sources.

494
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:43,880
And accountability.

495
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:44,759
Zero.

496
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,180
That was her word according to the sources.

497
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,420
Maintained she didn't deserve prison.

498
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,079
Said you choose to believe

499
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:52,059
whatever you choose to believe.

500
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,759
I can tell you I'm Jesus and you can see Jesus

501
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:55,940
or you can see the devil.

502
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:59,740
And then after the interview, she threatened the reporter.

503
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,460
Caught on camera saying she didn't like her.

504
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,200
Just couldn't help herself it seems.

505
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,460
Well the judge wasn't buying it.

506
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,160
Not at all.

507
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:08,380
The sources report she was sentenced to eight years

508
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:11,940
for the human trafficking and slavery of Desiree.

509
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:15,640
And that sentence plus her total lack of remorse

510
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,539
in that interview, it caused outrage.

511
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:20,859
Yeah, the sources say people were furious.

512
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,099
Calls for much harsher sentences,

513
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,880
even life in prison, which is possible for trafficking.

514
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:28,140
And the whole case sparked a bigger conversation.

515
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:28,680
Definitely.

516
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,579
About social media's impact,

517
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,960
the dangers of idolizing strangers online,

518
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:35,759
societal values, how women's insecurities

519
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:36,920
get turned into a business,

520
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,480
mentioning platforms like TikTok even.

521
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:41,380
Concerns about Zach, the husband too.

522
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,640
Not facing charges.

523
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,099
Yeah, the sources note concern that he,

524
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:47,339
described as an accomplice and known to be armed,

525
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:49,200
didn't face legal consequences.

526
00:19:49,579 --> 00:19:51,559
But investigations are ongoing in Brazil.

527
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,319
That's what the sources state.

528
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,700
Into other allegations against cat tours.

529
00:19:56,059 --> 00:19:58,420
So potentially more prison time down the road.

530
00:19:58,779 --> 00:19:59,980
For some victims though,

531
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,960
the conviction itself is a step towards healing.

532
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:04,279
It seems so.

533
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:06,500
One victim is quoted saying they feel better

534
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,660
because I know she's in jail.

535
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:11,160
Hoping more victims feel safe enough to come forward now.

536
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,039
But others still feel unsafe.

537
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,759
Even with the judge banning her

538
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:17,079
from the internet post release.

539
00:20:17,339 --> 00:20:19,880
Yeah, the fear is real according to the sources.

540
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,819
The feeling that she'll just re-offend,

541
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,299
as one source put it,

542
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,740

543
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,519

00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,700
And then peeling back these layers

548
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,480
of alleged manipulation, exploitation,

549
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:41,960
all reportedly hidden under that shiny online persona.

550
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,440
Yeah, we've looked at the tactics described,

551

00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:01,380
It really is how trust built on this carefully crafted image

557
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,599

559
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,940

How do we as people consuming online content

563
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,380

564
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:20,039
