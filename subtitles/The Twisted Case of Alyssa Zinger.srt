1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,099
Okay. Let's unpack this. We're diving deep today into the strange and pretty unsettling

2
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:12,300
case of Alyssa Zinger. It's a situation that, well, based on the sources we've looked at,

3
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:17,320
started with what seemed like a minor incident. Right. But it just unraveled fast into something

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,480
far more serious. Yeah, it really did. And for this deep dive, we've pulled from,

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,660
you know, a whole range of sources. Police reports, arrest affidavits, court documents.

6
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,420
Statements from law enforcement, too, again. Exactly. And even parts of body cam footage

7
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:36,759
that were presented in court, plus public reactions, commentary, and some research on the

8
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:43,299
impact, the devastating impact of this type of abuse. So our mission today is to guide you

9
00:00:43,299 --> 00:00:48,219
through this. Yeah. We want to lay out the, well, the complex allegations, trace the timeline as

10
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:52,979
best we can from the documents, examine the different perspectives these sources present,

11
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:56,619
because they really do conflict in places, you know? They do. And explore the implications

12
00:00:56,619 --> 00:01:01,740
of everything that's come to light so far. And it all begins quite unexpectedly, doesn't it?

13
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:07,959
Back on July 25th, 2023, the initial event was shoplifting. A Nordstrom in Tampa Bay, Florida,

14
00:01:08,539 --> 00:01:15,260
involved a girl and her 13-year-old boyfriend. And here's the first moment where, you know,

15
00:01:15,459 --> 00:01:18,480
reading through the reports, you kind of get a sense something isn't quite right.

16
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:25,040
When the officers asked the girl her age, she identified herself as Alyssa Zinger, said

17
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,299
she was 14, even give a birth date, January 1st, 2009. But the police system check,

18
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:35,719
it flagged something different. When they ran Alyssa Zinger, it came back with a 22-year-old,

19
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:40,319
Alyssa Ann Zinger. The date of birth just didn't line up at all. Not even close.

20
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:43,980
And she had an explanation, apparently. Right. She reportedly told the officers

21
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:48,019
the 22-year-old was her half-sister. But the sources show the name itself,

22
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,640
Alyssa Zinger versus Alyssa Ann Zinger, wasn't a perfect match either. And that age gap,

23
00:01:53,499 --> 00:01:56,579
obviously huge. Yeah, a big red flag. But despite that,

24
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,120
the reports indicate she was allowed to leave. With the boy and his father.

25
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,040
Yep, allowed to leave the scene that day with the boy and his father.

26
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,900
For that shoplifting incident, it kind of seemed to end there.

27
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,879
Okay. But the truth about who she really was, that came out later.

28
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:15,500
Uh-huh. About four months later, November 24th, 2023, she was arrested again.

29
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:20,360
But this time, for something much, much more serious, a grave alleged crime.

30
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,439
Exactly. It was then confirmed she was indeed Alyssa Zinger.

31
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:29,780
But 22 years old, not 14, employed part-time at Publix.

32
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,479
And the alleged reason for lying about her age back in July?

33
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:37,180
Well, according to the affidavits, it was because she was allegedly in a relationship

34
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,439
with a child. The same 13-year-old boy from the shoplifting?

35
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:42,620
The very same one. That's the allegation.

36
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:43,639
Wow. Okay.

37
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,000
That was really striking, as the sources lay it out,

38
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,060
is how she allegedly connected with these young people initially.

39
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:49,500
Right.

40
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,099
Affidavits states she befriended students at Woodrow Wilson Middle School,

41
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,360
using platforms like TikTok and Snapchat.

42
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,680
And she didn't just connect. The reports claim she built this whole persona online.

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,919
Yeah. Presenting herself as a 14-year-old, homeschooled.

44
00:03:03,939 --> 00:03:04,159
Okay.

45
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:09,080
And this online mass grade, this allegedly led to an inappropriate relationship

46
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,020
with one particular boy from that school.

47
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,560
And the timeline, the alleged timeline of their relationship.

48
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,360
The documents say they met in person late May 2023.

49
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,879
That's right. Late May.

50
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,039
And reportedly dated until mid-September 2023.

51
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,000
So about four months.

52
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,939
And during that period, the affidavit is pretty explicit.

53
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:33,599
It says she reportedly sent explicit images and videos of herself

54
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,120
to this victim using Snapchat.

55
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:37,620
Okay. So fast forward a bit.

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,780
October, after her alleged relationship with that first boy ended,

57
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,680
another incident happened involving him.

58
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:48,300
He had reportedly slept with a female minor.

59
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:51,099
Right. And that encounter was recorded on his phone.

60
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:51,699
Okay.

61
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:56,280
And sources indicate Alyssa allegedly found out about this video, learned it existed.

62
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:59,180
Which then led her to allegedly take steps to get it.

63
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,419
That's what the reports describe.

64
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:03,120
Going to the boy's home, claiming she needed to charge her phone,

65
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,520
kind of using that as an excuse to get inside.

66
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:05,939
Right.

67
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,360
And when she was in, the boy apparently went to the bathroom, left his phone unlocked.

68
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,120
And according to the court documents, she allegedly grabbed that chance.

69
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,560
Seized the moment, yeah.

70
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:19,660
Allegedly took his phone, recorded the intimate video right off his camera roll.

71
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:21,439
But it didn't stop there, did it?

72
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,519
With just taking the video.

73
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,740
No. The boy claimed, and this is documented,

74
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:28,420
that Alyssa then sent this video out.

75
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,040
To who?

76
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:30,620
To several of his classmates.

77
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:34,839
And also to the female minor who was in the video, again using Snapchat.

78
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,240
Okay. And the alleged motive.

79
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:38,819
Why would she do that?

80
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,920
The boy claimed it was jealousy.

81
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,839
Because their relationship had ended,

82
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,720
and this was like an attempt to get back at him, retaliation.

83
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:50,180
Wow. Now this, this is where things escalate really fast

84
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,699
and lead straight to her first arrest, right?

85
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,199
Exactly. The video circulating?

86
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:53,860
No.

87
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,540
That had immediate and serious consequences.

88
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,939
Students at the school reportedly saw it.

89
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,939
And they reported it.

90
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,120
Reported it to school staff.

91
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,720
And the school.

92
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,980
Their response, as described, was immediate.

93
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:07,660
Decisive. They called law enforcement right away.

94
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,139
Which started the investigation.

95
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:12,639
And led directly to her arrest on November 24, 2023.

96
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,660
And it was after this arrest that the Tampa Police Chief,

97
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:19,000
Lee Burkaw, made that statement, December 1, 2023.

98
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,740
Yeah. The sources quote him saying,

99
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,759
It is disturbing and unsettling to see an adult take advantage of a child and prey on them.

100
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,939
And her initial charges from the criminal report?

101
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:30,160
Seven felony counts.

102
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:31,839
Two for lascivious battery.

103
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,759
Five for lascivious solicitation.

104
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,040
And those charges specifically apply when the defendant is over 18

105
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,480
and the victim is, what, 12 to 15?

106
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,259
That's right. 12 to 15 years old.

107
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:44,019
So, seven serious felonies.

108
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,060
Okay. So, she's arrested on these seven felonies.

109
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,199
And here's where the public reaction really kicks in,

110
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:49,959
based on the commentary and our sources.

111
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:50,360
Right.

112
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,500
Shortly after that first arrest, she was bailed out.

113
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,560
Like, really quickly.

114
00:05:55,819 --> 00:05:57,560
Which, seven hours later, yeah, bailed out of jail.

115
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,620
And the bond about?

116
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:01,079
It was set at $7,500 for each charge.

117
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:01,939
Seven charges, so.

118
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:02,360
Yeah.

119
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,540
$52,500 total.

120
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:07,379
And the public commentary on that was pretty strong, wasn't it?

121
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:11,519
A lot of outrage, fear, people worried she was just walking free,

122
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,220
might prey on others.

123
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,920
There was also talk commentary about a perceived double standard.

124
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,800
Comparisons to how a male suspect might be treated in a similar situation.

125
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,439
Right. Some suggesting a man wouldn't have gotten bail,

126
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:26,620
wouldn't have been released, especially, you know,

127
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:29,500
given Florida's stance on crimes against children.

128
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:30,699
Yeah, if that point was raised.

129
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,620
And then kind of jarringly, the sources also included

130
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,959
some really dismissive online comments.

131
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,180
Yeah, those were disturbing.

132
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,759
Commentary that seemed to downplay how serious this was,

133
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:42,699
just because the alleged victims were teenage boys,

134
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:46,779
bringing up like hormones or sexual curiosity.

135
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:48,660
And we need to be crystal clear here,

136
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:51,920
reflecting the victim impact research we saw.

137
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,639
Adolescence, hormones, curiosity.

138
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,680
None of that makes a minor less of a victim.

139
00:06:58,819 --> 00:06:59,420
Absolutely not.

140
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,300
It doesn't justify or excuse inappropriate behavior by an adult.

141
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,420
The responsibility always 100% lies with the adult.

142
00:07:07,579 --> 00:07:09,519
And the impact is devastatingly real.

143
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,279
The sources included perspectives from male survivors of abuse by women.

144
00:07:13,579 --> 00:07:13,759
Yeah.

145
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:16,899
They described severe long-term effects, panic attacks,

146
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,759
nightmares, flinching, stuff that deeply impacts future relationships,

147
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:21,800
even brain chemistry.

148
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:25,720
Yes, and that aligns with an NCBI study mentioned in the materials.

149
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,680
It indicates both male and female victims of female perpetrators

150
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,000
can face profound long-term issues, substance abuse,

151
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:39,100
depression, rage, strained relationships with women.

152
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:41,519
Self-concept issues, identity problems.

153
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:41,839
Right.

154
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,819
Discomfort with intimacy later in life.

155
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:44,660
It's serious.

156
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,939
The fundamental principle holds true no matter the gender.

157
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,379
A minor can never consent to sex with an adult, period.

158
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:51,899
Exactly.

159
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:54,839
The abuse of that power, imbalance.

160
00:07:55,899 --> 00:07:59,439
The consequences can be just devastating and last a lifetime.

161
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:02,879
So the investigation continues after that first arrest,

162
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,319
and more information starts coming out from the initial boy victim.

163
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:06,620
Yeah.

164
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,180
He reportedly told officers that Alyssa had admitted to him,

165
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:12,019
admitted having intimate relations with other minors, too.

166
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:14,600
Which prompted Chief Burkha to make that public appeal.

167
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:14,980
Right.

168
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,259
Encouraging any other potential victims to come forward.

169
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:20,899
And the media echoed that, you know, urging parents to talk to their kids,

170
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:23,379
contact police if there had been any contact with her.

171
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:24,600
And that actually worked.

172
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,519
More alleged victims came forward.

173
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,100
It did.

174
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:29,060
Not long after her first arrest, yeah.

175
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,360
Four more alleged victims.

176
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,120
Reportedly between 12 and 14.

177
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,740
All from the same middle school.

178
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,220
Wow.

179
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,399
Four more.

180
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,240
And we saw some details from their accounts and the sources.

181
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,080
One boy claimed Alyssa approached him on TikTok first,

182
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,519
then they moved to Snapchat.

183
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,539
Met in person.

184
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,419
Met in person, and things became physical.

185
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,539
Another alleged a movie date,

186
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,139
then an intimate encounter at an apartment.

187
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:56,059
So these new allegations, they led directly to her being arrested again.

188
00:08:56,259 --> 00:08:56,960
Rearrested, yes.

189
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,039
On April 4th, 2024.

190
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,799
And with that second arrest came more charges.

191
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,559
A lot more.

192
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:06,559
Seven additional charges, bringing the total up to 14 felonies.

193
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,100
14.

194
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,080
Okay, what were the new ones?

195
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,379
Well, five more counts of lascivious solicitation.

196
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,159
Six more of lascivious battery.

197
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,039
So that's 11 of those total now.

198
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:17,740
But also one count of possession of CP child pornography.

199
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,440
One count of in-state transmission of CP by electronic device.

200
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,419
And one count of cyber harassment.

201
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:25,019
So the charges really escalated.

202
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:25,919
Massively.

203
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,919
But maybe one of the most striking and unexpected developments,

204
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:34,240
according to the sources, was the accusation that Alyssa's own parents

205
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,440
allegedly interfered with the investigation.

206
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,480
Interfered how?

207
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,580
Trying to protect her.

208
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,419
That's the allegation, deliberately.

209
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,820
Specifically, after the first arrest,

210
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,059
police got a warrant to search the parents home for Alyssa's cell phone.

211
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:48,700
Right.

212
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,080
When they asked for the phone,

213
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,360
her father allegedly handed over her mother's phone instead.

214
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,379
No way.

215
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,159
That's what's alleged.

216
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:57,919
And body cam footage, presented in court,

217
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,200
reportedly showed the officers struggling to figure out if the phone they were given was Alyssa's.

218
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,360
What did they notice?

219
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:05,940
It seemed to be out of battery.

220
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,620
Maybe put in airplane mode.

221
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,879
Just looks suspicious.

222
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,840
And when they asked for the passcode?

223
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,960
Both parents reportedly said they didn't know it.

224
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,500
And the judge commented on this.

225
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:15,720
Yeah.

226
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,759
Judge Laura Ward.

227
00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:21,659
At the pre-trial detention hearing, April 8, 2024, according to reports,

228
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:26,639
she expressed significant concern, said the parents' actions hindered the investigation,

229
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,740
helped their daughter evade accountability.

230
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:32,039
She said they compounded the situation, made it worse.

231
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,379
Exactly those words.

232
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:37,159
And the public reaction to that news, the parents' alleged involvement.

233
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,580
Intense anger, based on the commentary we saw,

234
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,659
people questioning why they hadn't been charged with obstruction.

235
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:47,980
Right, the Florida statute for tampering with evidence was brought up third degree felony.

236
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,980
Yeah, 918.13, punishable by up to five years, $5K fine.

237
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,720
That was part of the public discussion.

238
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:00,340
So we also get another glimpse into the family's perspective from more body cam footage.

239
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:04,299
Right, showing the parents interacting with officers outside their home another time.

240
00:11:04,419 --> 00:11:08,559
And this is where the father made that, what the source called a startling statement.

241
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:12,379
Yes, he allegedly placed the blame squarely on the victim.

242
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:15,980
Quote of this saying, she got messed up with the wrong kid.

243
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:17,879
Blaming the victim, wow.

244
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:19,440
Yeah, the reports detail his arguments.

245
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:24,700
Calling the victim insane, contrasting his daughter claims she was never in trouble,

246
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:27,480
a virgin till 21, a perfect angel.

247
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:32,779
With the victim's alleged lifestyle, describing him as 14 with girlfriends over,

248
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:34,460
making videos, make out sessions.

249
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:36,139
Right, that was his reported narrative.

250
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,139
And the public reaction to those comments.

251
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,759
Disgust, mostly.

252
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:42,259
Commentary calling him delusional.

253
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,279
Indenial, blaming a minor victim.

254
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,000
Some even speculated if he might be complicit somehow.

255
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:51,580
And his comments also hinted at a possible defense strategy,

256
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,759
mentioning she has problems and mental issues.

257
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:59,320
Exactly, which was echoed in court by her defense attorney, Data Hersey Fullgera.

258
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,100
Okay, what did the defense argue?

259
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,559
Reportedly argued, Alyssa has significant developmental issues,

260
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,860
emotional issues, low self-esteem, history of being bullied.

261
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,639
They showed family photos of her without eyelashes.

262
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,559
Yeah, allegedly as evidence of emotional struggles.

263
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,559
Noted she was in special ed, switched high schools.

264
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,539
The argument being that the text messages weren't between equals.

265
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:24,440
Right, that she was an adult interacting with kids

266
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,679
through the lens of her own alleged developmental issues.

267
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,299
That was the defense's angle.

268
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,080
But the prosecutor pushed back.

269
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:34,059
Strongly, argued her school records showed no signs of developmental delay,

270
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,559
and contended that, you know, any alleged mental health issues

271
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:40,759
don't excuse misrepresenting her age or targeting child victims.

272
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:45,360
Okay, then there was another fascinating moment on body cam.

273
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:49,580
When police went back in January 2024 to photograph her bedroom.

274
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:50,500
Yes.

275
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:55,019
And the father made another confession called startling.

276
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,519
Yeah, quite emotional apparently.

277
00:12:57,259 --> 00:13:00,460
He said the arrest, while awful, hadn't been entirely negative,

278
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:03,240
stating they finally got our daughter back.

279
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:03,899
Meaning what?

280
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:07,960
Described her now playing, watching TV, hanging out with them.

281
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,019
Added she wouldn't have a phone again.

282
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,240
And the public commentary on that confession.

283
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:16,440
Questioned if his sort of coddling might have contributed.

284
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,779
Some suggesting his treatment made her feel like she was 14, enabling the behavior.

285
00:13:21,019 --> 00:13:23,980
And Alyssa's own attitude during that bedroom search.

286
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,340
The footage reportedly showed her expressing frustration.

287
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,460
Annoyed about pictures being taken that police showed up without calling.

288
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,659
Feeling the treatment didn't fit the crime.

289
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:34,679
Like she felt like a murderer.

290
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:35,759
Something like that, yeah.

291
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,899
Seems largely dismissive of the police being there.

292
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,720
Okay, so let's summarize the alleged victims based on the sources.

293
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:43,320
Total is currently five male minors.

294
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:44,080
That's right.

295
00:13:44,419 --> 00:13:50,039
The initial 13-year-old plus four more boys aged 12 to 14, all from the same school.

296
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,419
And we have to remember the allegation about stealing and distributing the CP

297
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:54,820
involving the female minor.

298
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,120
Right.

299
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,320
Which adds another layer.

300
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,100
Suggest potential danger to young girls too.

301
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,960
So where does the case stand now, legally speaking?

302
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,960
Well, as of our last look at the sources, there's still no trial date set.

303
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,580
So no official verdict yet.

304
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:11,559
And the potential sentence if convicted on all 14 counts?

305
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,159
It's huge.

306
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,159
Up to 266 years potentially.

307
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:14,799
Yeah.

308
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:16,259
Sentences run consecutively.

309
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,240
Basically life.

310
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,919
Though, you know, sources note plea agreements or other factors could change that.

311
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:21,899
And her current status?

312
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:22,799
Where is she?

313
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,940
She remains in jail.

314
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:27,500
Held without bail since that second arrest back in April 2024.

315
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,960
And the judge's reason for denying bail back in April.

316
00:14:31,299 --> 00:14:33,019
Was pretty clear, according to reports.

317
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,940
Judge Ward stated the core issue wasn't who first recorded that video.

318
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:37,200
Right.

319
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,919
But that she, as an adult, was allegedly in multiple videos with young boys,

320
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,899
13 and 14, manipulating them, taking advantage.

321
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:46,220
That was the judge's focus.

322
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,399
Have there been more attempts to get her released on bond?

323
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,039
Yes, subsequent attempts.

324
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,100
For instance, at a June 3, 2024 court appearance,

325
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:00,299
defense argued for release again, citing her alleged psychological issues,

326
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:02,620
saying she's not a normal 22-year-old.

327
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:04,159
But the state opposed it.

328
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:04,919
Strongly.

329
00:15:05,659 --> 00:15:09,340
Hillsborough County prosecutor Tracy Dishman argued, as noted in the sources,

330
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:13,539
that there are no conditions of release reasonably sufficient to protect the community

331
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:17,779
from the risk of physical harms to persons, specifically males under 18.

332
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,700
And she's in protective custody in jail.

333
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,100
Reports mention that, yeah.

334
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:24,659
Apparently to prevent her using standard inmate tablets for communication.

335
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,159
Concern about social media access, maybe contacting others.

336
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,840
Okay, so as you can see, this case, it's really far from over.

337
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,360
Not at all.

338
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:37,879
Investigators reportedly believe there could still be more victims out there who haven't come forward yet.

339
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:42,700
Which means the full scope, the full impact of her alleged actions, it's still uncertain.

340
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,019
So we've tried to walk you through the key elements of this

341
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,379
deeply complex and troubling case of Alyssa Zimmer.

342
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:54,039
Yeah, from that initial shoplifting and the alleged age lie.

343
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:58,759
To the really disturbing details of online targeting.

344
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:02,259
The alleged relationships with multiple minors.

345
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:06,519
That whole video incident is the alleged theft and distribution.

346
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:07,179
Right.

347
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,480
And the serious accusations about her family's alleged involvement interfering with the investigation.

348
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:16,379
And just the ongoing complex legal process itself.

349
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,379
So thinking about all these different accounts of perspectives we've touched on,

350
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,299
from the sources, you know, the alleged actions.

351
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,179
The defense claims about mental issues.

352
00:16:25,659 --> 00:16:27,220
The father blaming the victim.

353
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,840
Yeah, all those conflicting layers.

354
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,600
What stands out to you the most?

355
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:33,639
About the complexities and the different viewpoints in this case.

356
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:34,519
Something to think about.

357
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,980
Definitely a lot to consider.

358
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,860
