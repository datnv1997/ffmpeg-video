1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,320
Welcome to the deep dive.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,339
So this time we're digging into the 2025

3
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:06,000
American Music Awards.

4
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:08,679
You know, the show that made a bit of a comeback this year.

5
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:10,060
Yeah, it was off the air for a bit.

6
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:12,380
We basically got a few different takes here.

7
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,619
There's a review from page six,

8
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,539
an article from the standard focusing

9
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:18,960
on Taylor Swift's absence,

10
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,339
which was a big talking point.

11
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:22,100
Right, and a USA Today preview

12
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,699
that kind of laid out the basics,

13
00:00:24,219 --> 00:00:26,920
how to watch who's up for awards performing,

14
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,480
and then the full rundown of who actually won

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,460
from CBS News.

16
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,619
Exactly, so whether you're a huge music fan

17
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:36,719
or maybe more interested in celebrity stuff

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,200
or maybe you just heard it was kind of

19
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,159
unmemorable and you're curious,

20
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,060
we've sort of sifted through all this stuff for you.

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,960
We're gonna try and unpack the main moments,

22
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:47,259
figure out why some big names stayed away,

23
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:48,799
look at the surprises in the winners list.

24
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:50,299
And just get a feel for the whole vibe

25
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:51,920
of the show this year based on these reports.

26
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:52,780
That's the plan.

27
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,179
Okay, so the AMAs, back for the 51st time,

28
00:00:56,179 --> 00:00:57,159
that's quite a run,

29
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,759
but it was the first proper show since 2022,

30
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,880
because last year was that 15th anniversary special thing.

31
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:05,379
And not in its usual home either.

32
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:07,159
No, that was a big change.

33
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,420
Yeah, traditionally it's always been in Los Angeles, right?

34
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,900
But this year, 2025,

35
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:13,000
they shipped it out to the Fontainebleau

36
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,819
in Las Vegas and a different TV network too.

37
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,480
It was on CBS after being on ABC for ages,

38
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,659
plus they aired it on Memorial Day.

39
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:22,180
Memorial Day, that's weird.

40
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,739
Is it normally like November before Thanksgiving?

41
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:26,900
Usually, yeah.

42
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:31,439
So quite a few major shifts, location, network, date.

43
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,579
You kind of have to wonder what the thinking was there,

44
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,700
trying to shake things up.

45
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,760
Logistics, who knows?

46
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:37,980
Yeah, it definitely makes you wonder.

47
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,840
And speaking of things missing,

48
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,500
a lot of big artists were missing too,

49
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,359
like absent from the ceremony itself.

50
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:45,959
Oh, for sure.

51
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,560
Taylor Swift being the big one, obviously.

52
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:49,959
She holds the record, what is it, 40 AMAs?

53
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:50,640
40, yeah.

54
00:01:51,099 --> 00:01:53,560
And the standard really zeroed in on her absence.

55
00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:56,400
Especially because the fans were so hyped up.

56
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,180
Oh, the fan speculation was intense.

57
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,480
I mean, the article gets into it,

58
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,040
how Swifties were decoding everything,

59
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:04,000
her online store, apparently the way things were categorized,

60
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,180
spelled out AMAs.

61
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,060
Yeah, and clues in the Handmaid's Tale somehow.

62
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,560
All pointing, they thought,

63
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,060
to her maybe announcing reputation.

64
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,280
Taylor's version.

65
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,500
Ah, the re-records.

66
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,240
Exactly, for anyone listening who doesn't follow closely,

67
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,680
that's Taylor re-recording her old albums.

68
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,659
And the date, May 26th,

69
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:25,139
was apparently significant in the fan theories too.

70
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,860
So yeah, the Swifties were ready,

71
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,300
but she wasn't there.

72
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,379
Nominated for six awards, I think.

73
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:32,539
Yep, six nominations.

74
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:34,340
Big ones too, Artist of the Year,

75
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:36,259
Album of the Year for Tortured Poets Department.

76
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,860
But didn't attend, didn't win any.

77
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,580
Nope, and then there was Kendrick Lamar,

78
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:41,919
he actually led the nominations, had 10.

79
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:44,960
10 AMAs, and he wasn't there either.

80
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:47,240
Also absent, Page Six mentioned he was on tour,

81
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,120
which makes sense, though interestingly,

82
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,939
his tourmate SCA did make it.

83
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:53,280
But it wasn't just them,

84
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,659
Billie Eilish won a ton of awards,

85
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,560
seven in total, also absent.

86
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,180
Seven awards and she didn't show up.

87
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:02,460
Wow, yeah, and that really brings up a big question,

88
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,039
you know, what to say about the AMAs

89
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,400
when so many of the top nominees,

90
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:06,580
especially for Artist of the Year,

91
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,060
I think SCA was the only one actually in the room

92
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:09,759
from that category.

93
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:10,560
Seriously?

94
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,400
Yeah, and the winner, Eilish,

95
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,699
just sent a video message.

96
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:17,180
It definitely makes you wonder if these big award shows

97
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,759
still have the same poll for artists anymore.

98
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:21,699
Hmm, good point, yeah.

99
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,259
Maybe their priorities are just shifting.

100
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,240
Now someone who was there, front and center,

101
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,840
was Jennifer Lopez, hosting again.

102
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:30,199
Second time hosting for her,

103
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,360
and Page Six actually called her opening number one

104
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,379
of the quote, best moments.

105
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,599
Okay, what did she do?

106
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,419
A big dance medley, high energy,

107
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:41,360
lots of recent hits mashed up

108
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,840
like Eilish's Birds of a Feather,

109
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:46,860
Sabrina Carpenter's Espresso, Shibuzi's Tipsy,

110
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,639
even Kendrick's Not Like Us.

111
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,300
Wow, okay, covering all the bases.

112
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:52,060
Yeah, and Benson Boone's Beautiful Things,

113
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:53,900
Kissing Dancers, the whole J-Lo spectacle,

114
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,479
sounds like a strong start.

115
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,319
But, I feel a butt coming.

116
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:58,020
Well, yeah.

117
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,560
The same review then listed her being a quote,

118
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,340
non-host for the rest of the night

119
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,900
as one of the worst moments.

120
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:05,659
Oof, non-host.

121
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,819
Apparently, Nikki Glaser,

122
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,219
who was just presenting an award,

123
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,259
made more of an impact.

124
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:12,099
The review suggested J-Lo's hosting felt more like

125
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:13,460
just a series of costume changes

126
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,599
after that opening burst.

127
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,259
So, kind of fell flat after the big intro.

128
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,220
That's the vibe you get from page six, yeah.

129
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,500
They did admit she brought star power,

130
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,439
but maybe the actual hosting part

131
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:25,459
wasn't consistently engaging.

132
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:25,920
Gotcha.

133
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,839
Okay, what about other performances?

134
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:29,319
There was a mix, right?

135
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:30,660
Benson Boone got a good mention.

136
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,839
Yeah, page six called his performance

137
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,540
of magical mystical another best moment,

138
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,279
saw him as a welcome,

139
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,120
like, young, energetic presence,

140
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,120
glittery, purple suit, apparently.

141
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,680
Nice.

142
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,060
Maybe a sign the reviewer wanted more

143
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,259
of that current rising star energy.

144
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:47,860
Makes sense.

145
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:49,399
Then we had Gwen Stefani,

146
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:50,879
introduced by Blake Shelton.

147
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,920
She performed too, right?

148
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,180
Yep, Blake did his thing.

149
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,439
Gwen did a medley Shallow My Tears,

150
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,399
but also the classic sweet escape,

151
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,319
Hollaback Girl.

152
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,019
Oh yeah.

153
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:01,319
Page six said it felt a bit vegas-y,

154
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,839
which, okay, they were in Vegas,

155
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:05,819
but mostly framed as a nostalgia trip.

156
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,459
Right, and Janet Jackson icon award,

157
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:09,019
that's huge.

158
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,279
Definitely a big moment.

159
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:12,519
Her first TV performance in, what, seven years,

160
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,019
she did someone to call my lover and all for you.

161
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,899
Classic Janet.

162
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:16,480
For sure.

163
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:18,199
Though the review wasn't thrilled

164
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:20,379
with the presenter choice for her award,

165
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:22,579
Tisha Smith for a co-star from a movie.

166
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:23,720
Oh, why not?

167
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,800
They felt someone with a stronger musical connection,

168
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,959
like Ciara or SCA, who she clearly influenced,

169
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,860
or even J.Lo would have felt more significant, you know?

170
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,639
Yeah, I could see that.

171
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,740
Presentation matters for those big awards.

172
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:39,279
And speaking of moments that didn't quite land,

173
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:42,899
Renee Rapp performed her new song, Leave Me Alone.

174
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:43,639
Okay.

175
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,819
The reviewer wasn't impressed,

176
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,139
felt like with so many other big stars absent,

177
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:51,160
giving that prime spot to someone performing new material,

178
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:54,500
they kind of implied she hadn't quite earned it yet,

179
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:56,860
or at least needed to really knock it out of the park.

180
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,819
Ouch, so again, hinting that maybe the performance lineup

181
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:02,399
wasn't as star-studded as it could have been.

182
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:04,439
That seems to be the underlying feeling, yeah.

183
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,779
Like the show was missing some top-tier firepower.

184
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:09,420
Rod Stewart also got a Lifetime Achievement Award

185
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,660
and performed Forever Young,

186
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,019
and Gloria Estefan performed, too,

187
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,600
first time in 30 years, apparently.

188
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,920
Wow, 30 years.

189
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,319
Okay, let's talk about the awards themselves then.

190
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:20,660
Billie Eilish clearly had a huge night,

191
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:21,600
even though she wasn't there.

192
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:22,560
Absolutely massive.

193
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,300
Artist of the Year, song of the year for Birds of a Feather,

194
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,560
favorite touring artist, pop female artist,

195
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:31,079
pop album for Hit Me Hard and Soft, pop song.

196
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,139
I mean, she swept quite a bit.

197
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,779
Really shows her fan connection, I guess,

198
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:35,699
since it's fan-voted.

199
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:38,459
Exactly, that's the whole point of the AMAs, supposedly.

200
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:41,439
But then Kendrick Lamar, who had the most nominations,

201
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,379
only won one award.

202
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,000
Just one.

203
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:46,500
Favorite hip-hop song for Not Like Us.

204
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:49,699
That's a pretty big gap between nominations and wins.

205
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:50,660
Yeah, definitely.

206
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:51,360
Definitely.

207
00:06:54,859 --> 00:06:57,819
And the AMAs might be, well, out of touch.

208
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,000
Oh, who won that?

209
00:06:59,199 --> 00:06:59,620
Eminem.

210
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:00,980
Eminem, over Kendrick.

211
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:03,459
And Drake, Future, Tyler the Creator,

212
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,759
were nominated, too.

213
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:07,240
Exactly, the reviews saw that as exhibit A

214
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,819
for why maybe the show isn't taken that seriously by everyone,

215
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,740
felt outdated.

216
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,480
They also thought Heidi Klum presenting it was a bit random.

217
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,139
Okay, that is surprising.

218
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:17,220
What about Country?

219
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,680
Post Malone did well there.

220
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:21,060
One favorite country song for the track

221
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,680
with Morgan Wallin, I had some help.

222
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:25,240
And favorite male country artist.

223
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,759
And Beyonce continued her country crossover success.

224
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:31,360
Favorite female country artist

225
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,060
and favorite country album for Cowboy Carter.

226
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:36,279
Makes sense, that album was everywhere.

227
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:36,899
For sure.

228
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,300
And there's that little moment,

229
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,139
Page Six caught Shibuzy presenting with Megan Moroney.

230
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:43,420
Yeah, what happened?

231
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,100
Apparently, when Moroney read the teleprompter line

232
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,939
about the Carter family basically inventing country music,

233
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,980
Shibuzy gave her this noticeable side-eye.

234
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,600
Oh, really?

235
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,120
Yeah, the review clarified she was just reading the script.

236
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,339
It wasn't her saying it.

237
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,100
But it kind of subtly highlighted the whole conversation

238
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,839
around the black roots of country music,

239
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:04,579
which Shibuzy is obviously part of,

240
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:05,899
just a small visual thing.

241
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:06,420
But interesting.

242
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:08,000
Yeah, those little moments can say a lot.

243
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,100
Who else won big?

244
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,399
Gracie Abrams got New Artist of the Year?

245
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:12,720
Yep, Gracie Abrams.

246
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:15,959
Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars won video and collaboration

247
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,000
for Die with a Smile.

248
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,360
Bruno also got Male Pop Artist.

249
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:23,579
SEA won Female R&B Artist and R&B Song for Saturn.

250
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:27,560
The Weekend took Male R&B Artist and R&B Album.

251
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,839
Latin went to Bad Bunny, Becky G and Shakira for Song.

252
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:32,360
Got it.

253
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,799
Megan Thee Stallion for Female Hip-Hop Artist.

254
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:37,899
Eminem also won Hip-Hop Album for his new one.

255
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,399
21 Pilots swept Rock Artist and Album.

256
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,120
Lincoln Park won Rock Song.

257
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,480
Lady Gaga again for Dance Electronic.

258
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,419
Even an award for a soundtrack arcane League of Legends.

259
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,960
Wow, okay, broad range.

260
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,460
Yeah, Tyler won Afro Beats, RM won K-Pop.

261
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,100
So lots of different fan bases represented.

262
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:57,960
But notably, Taylor Swift, zero wins

263
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,899
from her six nominations.

264
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,659
Yeah, that's the other big takeaway

265
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:02,019
from the winner's list, I guess.

266
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,159
No Swift wins this year.

267
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,139
Kind of surprising, right?

268
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:06,779
Maybe just tougher competition in her categories this year

269
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:07,899
or the fans voted differently.

270
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,399
So let's try and wrap this up.

271
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,220
What's the overall feeling from these sources?

272
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,200
What are the main takeaways?

273
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:14,100
Well, page six was pretty blunt.

274
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,259
They called it unmemorable.

275
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,860
And that AARP Music Awards comment.

276
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:18,539
Yeah, that stinks.

277
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,299
It definitely suggests they felt it skewed older,

278
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,080
focusing on legacy acts,

279
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:24,960
maybe because a lot of the current

280
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,440
big chart toppers weren't there.

281
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,279
And the move to Vegas, Memorial Day, CVS.

282
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,039
It doesn't seem like those changes

283
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,700
really brought in the A-list buzz.

284
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,759
They might have hoped for.

285
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:36,559
It doesn't seem like it, based on these reports.

286
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:38,779
The absences were just too noticeable.

287
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,139
It makes you question if these big traditional award shows

288
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:44,279
are maybe struggling a bit to stay relevant,

289
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,440
or at least relevant to the artists themselves.

290
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:49,279
So despite a few bright spots, JLo's opening,

291
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,759
Vincent Boone getting some praise.

292
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:55,159
The general vibe was a bit lackluster.

293
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,440
A show having trouble attracting the really big names.

294
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,580
That's certainly the picture painted here, yeah.

295
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,320
When so many nominees and even winners

296
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,559
like Billie Eilish aren't showing up,

297
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,860
it definitely sends a message, intended or not.

298
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:09,639
Right, it raises those bigger questions

299
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:11,419
about what these shows are even for anymore.

300
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,279
Especially in the streaming era

301
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,440
where artists have direct lines to fans.

302
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,059
Exactly.

303
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,080
So here's something to chew on then.

304
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:21,080
If so many top nominees and winners are skipping out,

305
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,120
what does that actually tell us

306
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,559
about Music Award shows right now?

307
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,480
Are they still reflecting what fans truly care about,

308
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,379
or who's really leading the industry?

309
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:32,519
Yeah, and is the whole fan-voted thing still working

310
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:35,539
if the artists it's supposed to celebrate

311
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:37,860
don't seem to prioritize being there?

312
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,120
It's a tough question.

313
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,039
Definitely something to think about.

314
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:41,740
For sure.

315
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,519
And hey, if you're curious to judge for yourself,

316
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:46,139
you can probably find clips of the performances online.

317
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,600
And the full winners list is out there too

318
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,600
if you want to dive deeper into who won what.

319
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:51,279
Good point.

320
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,399
Always worth forming your own opinion.
