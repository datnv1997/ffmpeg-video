00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,140
Pauline Parker and Juliet Hume, the friendship that led to murder. The world of crime has seen

2
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:15,720
its fair share of chilling partnerships, but few are as infamous as the one shared by Pauline

3
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:23,859
Parker and Juliet Hume. These two schoolgirls from New Zealand shocked the nation in 1954,

4
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:30,059
when their intense friendship culminated in the brutal murder of Pauline's mother,

5
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:36,820
Honora Parker. When they were both in their early teens, though from different backgrounds,

6
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:44,479
they quickly became inseparable. Pauline was the daughter of a working-class family. While Juliet

7
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:52,240
came from a more privileged background her father, Henry Hume was a noted physicist and

8
00:00:52,240 --> 00:01:00,020
rector of the University of Canterbury. Juliet had a cosmopolitan upbringing. Having lived in

9
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:06,640
England and South Africa before settling in New Zealand, both girls were intelligent,

10
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:14,780
academically bright, and shared a passion for literature and fantasy worlds. What drew them

11
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:22,140
together, however, was more than just common interests. Both girls had experienced illnesses

12
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:29,120
that left them somewhat isolated from their peers Pauline suffered from osteomyelitis,

13
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:35,719
a painful bone infection, and Juliet had suffered bots of tuberculosis.

14
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:43,459
This isolation fostered a deep bond between them, a connection that quickly grew into something

15
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:50,780
intense and all-consuming, a fantasy world of their own. As their friendship blossomed,

16
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:58,780
Pauline and Juliet created a rich fantasy world, which they called the fourth world. It was a place

17
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:05,700
where they could escape the mundane reality of their everyday lives and indulge in elaborate

18
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:14,680
fantasies of romance, adventure, and grandeur. They wrote stories, poems, and plays set in this

19
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:23,800
imaginary world drawing inspiration from historical figures and film stars. Their bond became more

20
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:30,520
than just friendship. It was almost like a shared identity. The intensity of their relationship

21
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:37,879
began to concern those around them. The girls' parents and teachers noticed how they withdrew

22
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:43,939
from others, spending all their time together, wrapped up in their elaborate fantasies.

23
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,599
Some speculated that the relationship was romantic, though there was little

24
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:56,539
concrete evidence to support this. What was clear, however, was that their friendship

25
00:02:56,539 --> 00:03:06,520
had become obsessive. Parental concerns and separation, by 1954, the parents of both girls

26
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:12,000
had become increasingly worried about the unhealthy closeness of their relationship.

27
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:18,639
Juliet's parents were particularly concerned, especially as they were going through their

28
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:25,479
own marital difficulties. That year Henry Hume resigned from his position as rector

29
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:34,500
and plan at take Juliet back to England. Leaving behind his wife Hilda and New Zealand,

30
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:41,539
Pauline's parents were equally alarmed by the impending separation, believing it would be

31
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:49,419
best for the two girls to spend time apart. Pauline, however, was devastated by the thought

32
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:57,740
of Juliet leaving. She became increasingly resentful of her mother, Honora, whom she believed

33
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:11,520
was standing in the way of her being with Juliet. The two girls began to devise a plan, a

34
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:21,360
on the 22nd of June 1954, Pauline and Juliet lowered Pauline's mother to Victoria Park in

35
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:29,220
Christchurch under the pretext of a pleasant walk. Unbeknownst to Honora, the girls had brought with

36
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,639
them a half brick, wrapped in a stocking. As they walked along a secluded path,

37
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:41,939
they attacked Honora, bludgeoning her repeatedly until she died from severe head injuries.

38
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:49,519
It was a gruesome and cold blooded act, one that shocked not only the people of Christchurch,

39
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:57,060
but the entire world when news of the murder broke, the police quickly pieced together what

40
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:04,079
had happened. Both girls were arrested and, during their subsequent interrogation, freely

41
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:10,860
admitted to the murder, their diaries provided further damning evidence Pauline had written

42
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:18,740
extensively about their plan and the days leading up to the crime. In one entry, she coldly stated,

43
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:26,100
The happy vent has taken place. All went according to plan, trial and sentencing.

44
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:35,959
The trial of Pauline Parker and Juliet Hume took place in August 1954 and was a media sensation.

45
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:42,920
The public was fascinated by the seemingly privileged and intelligent girls who had committed

46
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:50,620
such a brutal murder during the trial. The defense argued that the girls were suffering from a folly

47
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:59,300
a dirt-shared psychotic disorder that had caused them to lose touch with reality. The prosecution,

48
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:07,740
however, painted a picture of cold, calculated murder driven by their desire to be together

49
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:14,360
without the interference of Pauline's mother. Ultimately, both girls were found guilty,

50
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:19,879
but due to their young age Pauline was sixteen and Juliet fifteen.

51
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:28,399
They were not sentenced to death. Instead, they were sentenced to be detained at Her Majesty's

52
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:35,420
pleasure, a term used for indefinite imprisonment. The girls were separated and sent to different

53
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:43,180
prisons, and they would never see each other again. Life after prison, Pauline and Juliet

54
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:50,279
were both released from prison after serving around five years, under strict conditions

55
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:56,699
that they never contact each other again. Upon release, they disappeared from the public eye,

56
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,980
adopting new identities and living quiet private lives. Pauline Parker took the name

57
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:11,639
Hillary Nathan and lived a reclusive life in England. Working as a writing instructor,

58
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:19,300
she reportedly became deeply religious and expressed remorse for her actions, though she

59
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:26,579
has never publicly spoken about the murder. Juliet Hume, on the other hand, reinvented

60
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:33,540
herself as in Perry and went on to become a successful crime novelist under this name.

61
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:39,800
She wrote numerous best-selling detective novels and only reluctantly acknowledged

62
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:48,220
her past when it was revealed by the media in the 1990s, while Perry has expressed regret

63
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:55,879
for the murder. She has also stated that she has paid for her crime and does not feel the need

64
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:03,300
to discuss it publicly. Cultural legacy, the story of Pauline Parker and Juliet Hume

65
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:10,540
has remained a source of fascination for decades. The case has been the subject of numerous books,

66
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:18,220
documentaries, and even a film Heavenly Creatures 1994, directed by Peter Jackson,

67
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:25,720
brought the story to a new generation and remains a landmark to fiction of their intense

68
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:32,620
friendship and the murder that followed. The case continues to raise questions about the nature

69
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:40,519
of obsessive relationships, the vulnerability of adolescence, and the fine line between fantasy

70
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:49,100
and reality. It also poses a darker question. Could the intense bond between Pauline and Juliet

71
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:56,700
have been controlled, or were they always destined to spiral into tragedy? The story of Pauline

72
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:03,440
Parker and Juliet Hume remains one of New Zealand's most infamous criminal cases.

73
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:11,100
What began as an intense friendship spiraled into a murder that stunned the world. Though both

74
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:16,980
women have served their time and moved on with their lives, the crime they committed

75
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:24,580
continues to intrigue, puzzle, and horrify in equal measure. Their case serves as a chilling

76
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:32,419
reminder of the destructive power of obsessive relationships and the dark turns that even

77
00:09:32,419 --> 00:09:34,940
the closest of friendships can take.
