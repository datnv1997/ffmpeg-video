00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,980
Welcome to the Deep Dive.

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,620
Today, we're plunging into quite a sack of sources,

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,900
social media, news reports, YouTube,

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,619
medical opinions, all swirling around one,

5
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,000
while truly unforgettable, viral event.

6
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:15,119
The woman who used Gorilla Glue spray in her hair.

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,719
Our mission here is to take all these pieces,

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,440
try to untangle the, frankly, chaotic sequence of events,

9
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:23,940
explore the really intense public reactions,

10
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,820
and, maybe most importantly, uncover

11
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,980
the completely unexpected twist that came out of it all.

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:30,800
Let's unpack this.

13
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:32,200
Yeah, it's one of those stories

14
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,640
that start almost like internet absurdity, didn't it?

15
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,960
But when you really dig into the sources,

16
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:38,820
it gets much more complex.

17
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:40,859
It highlights some, well, fascinating,

18
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,759
and sometimes pretty troubling things

19
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:43,719
about our online world.

20
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:44,439
Absolutely.

21
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,579
So let's set the scene.

22
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:47,520
This all kicks off with Tessica Brown.

23
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:49,079
She's a 40-year-old woman from Louisiana.

24
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:50,500
And it's February 3rd.

25
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:51,859
She uploads his TikTok, right?

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,060
Showing her hair pulled back, really tight ponytail.

27
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,880
And her explanation, at least according to her video,

28
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,979
was that she ran out of her normal stuff,

29
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:00,039
got to be glue spray,

30
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,500
which people use for, like, extreme hold.

31
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,319
Yeah, that's a known product for that kind of thing.

32
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:04,879
Exactly.

33
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:06,700
And she grabs Gorilla Glue spray instead,

34
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,159
thinking somehow it would just hold the style.

35
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:11,459
Right, not just any glue,

36
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:13,280
but, you know, industrial adhesive.

37
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,719
Not for hair.

38
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:16,640
And the immediate problem,

39
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,420
well, it was exactly what you might fear.

40
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:20,739
Her hair was just cemented,

41
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:23,239
completely stuck to her head, unmovable.

42
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,719
She even said in that first video,

43
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:27,180
and this quote really stuck,

44
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,900
my hair has been like this for about a month now.

45
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:30,959
It's not a choice.

46
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,000
A month.

47
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:32,799
A whole month.

48
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,040
Can you imagine the discomfort?

49
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:34,420
Yeah.

50
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:35,200
Just, wow.

51
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,760
And her attempts to fix it, they got pretty desperate.

52
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,560
She mentioned washing it, what, 15 times.

53
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,560
15 times, yeah.

54
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:41,219
And nothing.

55
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,219
Follow-up videos showed her getting really frustrated,

56
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:45,420
you know, trying different things, even in tears.

57
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,060
And that vulnerability, that visible struggle,

58
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,260
I think that's probably what made it go

59
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,120
so incredibly viral, so fast.

60
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,040
Oh, definitely.

61
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:55,200
It just struck a chord.

62
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,939
On one hand, you had total confusion,

63
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,900
disbelief, you know, the,

64
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:01,079
why would you even do that reaction?

65
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,760
But the source is, it wasn't just that,

66
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:07,200
there was also this weird mix of like dark humor,

67
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,560
but also some real empathy starting to bubble up.

68
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,860
People saw the distress,

69
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,819
even if the initial choice seemed baffling.

70
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:15,180
That sort of reaction storm confusion,

71
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,240
amusement, sympathy, it's classic viral fuel.

72
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,560
And once it blew up, oh man,

73
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,580
the device started pouring in from commenters.

74
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,520
We saw everything.

75
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,219
Some sounded vaguely plausible,

76
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,300
like soaking her head in alcohol and water.

77
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:30,960
Someone mentioned a specific 25% alcohol mix.

78
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:33,259
Right, 75% water, and then other stuff.

79
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,379
Coconut oil, tea tree oil, olive oil,

80
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:38,020
even like physically trying to pry it apart

81
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:38,900
with a fork or something.

82
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,219
Yeah, and importantly, a nurse did chime in, apparently,

83
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:43,860
warning her not to just pour alcohol on her head,

84
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,259
but to apply it carefully.

85
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:46,900
Which, you know, shows how quickly

86
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,560
bad advice can spread right alongside

87
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,759
the good intentions online.

88
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:50,539
Good point.

89
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:52,520
Viral advice isn't always vetted advice.

90
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,879
So she tried some of it.

91
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:56,460
Sources say she did the coconut and tea tree oil thing

92
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,379
overnight, wrapped her head in plastic, didn't work.

93
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,360
So the next logical step, professional help.

94
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:03,860
She entered by going to the ER

95
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,360
at St. Bernard Parish Hospital.

96
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,219
That was February 6th.

97
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,599
And this is where it gets interesting,

98
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,800
because even the medical pros were a bit thrown.

99
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,520
Sources say the nurses there tried acetone.

100
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,419
Now, a dermatologist later said

101
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:17,580
acetone could potentially work on the adhesive.

102
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:18,659
Right, I saw that video.

103
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:21,620
Yeah, but for Tessica, it apparently just burned her scalp,

104
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,639
made the glee kind of gooey for a second,

105
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:25,280
and then it just hardened right back up.

106
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,719
So not the quick fix anyone was hoping for.

107
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:32,419
We saw that dermatologist Dr. Dustin Portella

108
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:35,039
weigh in around February 5th.

109
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,539
He mentioned acetone, yeah,

110
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,360
but warned it could be irritating, drying.

111
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,120
He also suggested maybe a professional salon

112
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,139
or seeing a dermatologist if the irritation got bad.

113
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,800
And he floated Gugan as like a last resort, maybe.

114
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,960
But caution heavily, it's not meant for skin,

115
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,340
only carefully on the hair if acetone failed.

116
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:54,479
It just shows how unique this situation was.

117
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,659
Experts were having the sort of brainstorm solutions

118
00:03:56,659 --> 00:03:57,280
on the fly.

119
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:00,259
Exactly, it's that challenge of the digital age, isn't it?

120
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,080
Something totally unprecedented goes viral,

121
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,500
and suddenly everyone's throwing out ideas,

122
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,300
experts, and amateurs alike.

123
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:06,780
Totally.

124
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,360
And while she's dealing with all this physical stuff,

125
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,639
the media frenzy is just exploding.

126
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,659
That first TikTok got insane views, like immediately.

127
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,680
By February 8th, it's national news, TMZ is all over it.

128
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,199
Of course.

129
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,360
Even celebrities started talking about it.

130
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:24,800
Chance the Rapper tweeted something supportive,

131
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:28,060
basically saying maybe she genuinely didn't realize

132
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,459
how bad it would be, and it was hard to laugh

133
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:32,220
seeing her actual distress.

134
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:34,519
That amplification is just massive, isn't it?

135
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:37,699
A mistake shared online becomes this huge global thing

136
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:39,579
in like two days.

137
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,720
And the public reaction really split.

138
00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:43,379
You had a lot of sympathy, definitely.

139
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:46,079
People were suggesting maybe she mixed it up

140
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,680
with Gorilla Snot Edge Control.

141
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:50,079
Similar name used for hair.

142
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:52,259
Right, the name similarity is definitely there.

143
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:54,339
People were saying it could have been an honest mistake.

144
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:56,040
But then you had the other side.

145
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:57,519
Pretty harsh criticism.

146
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,759
Questioning her intelligence, pointing out she's 40,

147
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,240
the warning labels are obvious.

148
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:04,420
Some people even thought the whole thing was stage.

149
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:06,540
Yeah, the planned for clout argument,

150
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:07,879
people asking things like,

151
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,420
well, why aren't her hands stuck too if she sprayed it?

152
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,040
And someone countered the Gorilla Snot idea

153
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,139
by pointing out it comes in a squeeze bottle,

154
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,379
not a spray can like the glue she used.

155
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:19,759
But that detail just added more fuel

156
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,259
to the online debate, you know.

157
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,720
Mistakers don't.

158
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:25,079
Even the company, Gorilla Glue,

159
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,399
put out a statement around February 8th.

160
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,939
They basically said they felt bad about it,

161
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,339
hoped she got good medical care,

162
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:32,560
and gently reminded everyone

163
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,800
their product isn't for hair.

164
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,839
Right, trying to distance themselves a bit.

165
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,500
But understandably.

166
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,139
Meanwhile, in the middle of all this,

167
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,860
Tessica starts to go fund me.

168
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,860
That was February 7th.

169
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,540
And it took off, raised over $23,000 really fast.

170
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:46,379
Oh, wow.

171
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,600
Which, again, sparked more conversation.

172
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,959
Especially because she started using the name

173
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,220
Gorilla Glue Girl herself

174
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:55,139
in like a YouTube video title that same day.

175
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:57,220
That's interesting, kind of claiming the narrative

176
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,180
while still going through it.

177
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:59,180
It's a very modern thing,

178
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,500
that rapid shift to owning the viral identity.

179
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:03,100
Definitely.

180
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,560
But okay, back to the actual glue problem.

181
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,040
Home remedies failed, the ER couldn't quite crack it.

182
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,860
The sources show it became clear

183
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,060
she needed something more serious,

184
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,899
like surgical intervention.

185
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,740
On February 9th, she announced

186
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,939
she was going to see a surgeon.

187
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,860
And this is where Dr. Michael Obang

188
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,860
enters the story out in Los Angeles.

189
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,720
According to TMZ reports around the 9th,

190
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,160
he saw her situation online,

191
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,480
realized how bad it was,

192
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,360
and made this incredible offer to do the surgery

193
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,620
to free her scalp for free.

194
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:33,319
That's amazing.

195
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:36,339
Saved her something like $12,500, the report said.

196
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:36,759
Yeah.

197
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:39,699
So the surgery happened on February 11th.

198
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,939
And based on the footage, it looked pretty intense.

199
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,639
Surgeons carefully, gradually unsticking the hair.

200
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,600
Dr. Obang had figured out the main chemical was polyurethane,

201
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,199
so they used specific solvents designed to dissolve that.

202
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,560
He apparently even tried reaching out to gorilla glue

203
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,339
to see if they had any special removers,

204
00:06:55,339 --> 00:06:56,680
didn't get through directly, it seems.

205
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:59,360
And Dr. Obang's description really hit home

206
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,199
how bad it was.

207
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:02,019
He called it no joke.

208
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,600
Talked about the hair damage,

209
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:05,259
the constant pulling on her scalp,

210
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:06,660
how she couldn't sleep properly.

211
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,240
He said it was like having a stick stuck to your head.

212
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,360
Just constant discomfort and anxiety.

213
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,339
She apparently needed medication before the surgery

214
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:15,759
just to handle the stress.

215
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,040
So it wasn't just cosmetic.

216
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,980
It was genuinely causing physical and mental anguish.

217
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,639
Absolutely.

218
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,199
Which makes the footage from right after the surgery

219
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,839
on the 11th so striking.

220
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:28,000
You see her relief checking out her hair, finally free.

221
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,680
Dr. Obang mentioned follow-ups, pain meds,

222
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:31,939
but the glue was gone.

223
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,579
Must have been an incredible feeling

224
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:35,660
after a solid month of that ordeal.

225
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,420
You'd think, okay, story over, right.

226
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,740
She's free, she can move on.

227
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,639
But the aftermath had more drama.

228
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:44,000
The very next day, February 12th,

229
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,800
merch drops, t-shirts with her picture

230
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,980
or like a cartoon gorilla glue can

231
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,040
and the slogan bonded for life.

232
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,459
Oof.

233
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,720
Yeah, that didn't land well with everyone.

234
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:55,420
The backlash was pretty swift.

235
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,680
A lot of the sympathy seemed to evaporate overnight.

236
00:07:58,139 --> 00:07:59,579
People were criticizing her hard

237
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:00,860
for trying to profit off it.

238
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:03,819
Comments like just no or really harsh ones

239
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:06,319
like write a book on how important reading is.

240
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:08,319
That sense of betrayal again.

241
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,620
We were rooting for you, now you're selling merch.

242
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,259
Yeah, and suggestions to donate the money instead.

243
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:16,600
Maybe to charities providing wigs for cancer patients,

244
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:17,300
things like that.

245
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:19,779
Some people flat out said they were unfollowing her.

246
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,920
It was a sharp turn in public opinion.

247
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,160
But she responded quickly to that criticism.

248
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:26,660
On February 13th, she announced

249
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,279
she was donating $20,000 from the GoFundMe.

250
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,139
Remember, it raised over 23K

251
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:35,320
to Dr. Obang's non-profit foundation, Restore,

252
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:36,919
which is reconstructive surgery.

253
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,200
Okay, that's significant.

254
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,700
And she said the rest would go to three local families.

255
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,179
She posted a picture with Dr. Obang thanking him,

256
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,059
saying he gave me my life back.

257
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,919
And that move, donating most of the money,

258
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:50,879
probably did a lot to counter the profiting narrative.

259
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,940
It showed gratitude and an intention to give back,

260
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:56,759
which definitely complicated things for the critics.

261
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:59,100
Yeah, it added nuance back into the story.

262
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,639
There were also some lingering legal things

263
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:02,240
floating around.

264
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,700
Remember those early reports she might sue, Gorilla Glue?

265
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,799
Right, though our sources didn't really

266
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,019
confirm that panning out.

267
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:11,840
No, but her lawyer did apparently send

268
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,580
a cease and desist letter to some blogger

269
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,659
who was claiming the whole story was fake.

270
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,440
The lawyer confirmed, nope, it was real.

271
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,480
Which just goes to show,

272
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,799
even when something is documented like this,

273
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,799
people will still call it fake online.

274
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:27,480
And sometimes you need lawyers to push back, it's wild.

275
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:30,039
So, trying to move past it all,

276
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,320
on February 17th, she posted pics of a new haircut.

277
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,059
Short.

278
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:36,620
And the caption was, I am not my hair.

279
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,259
Thinking supporters, saying the good outweigh the bad overall.

280
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,100
And the reaction to the haircut seemed mostly positive.

281
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:45,419
Yeah, generally, like fresh start, looks cute,

282
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:46,559
you can rock short styles.

283
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:50,000
People seemed ready to see her move on, visually at least.

284
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:51,379
A physical change signaling,

285
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,240
maybe a new chapter after all that public chaos.

286
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:56,240
But the story didn't just end with her,

287
00:09:56,779 --> 00:09:57,519
the ripple spread.

288
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,700
Its sheer virality seemed to,

289
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,460
well, inspire others, not always in a good way.

290
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,279
Yes, the copycat effect.

291
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,740
A really dark side of viral fame,

292
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:08,460
where people try to replicate the attention,

293
00:10:08,659 --> 00:10:09,799
sometimes dangerously.

294
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:11,799
Like Len Martin, the guy in Baton Rouge.

295
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,940
Oh right, he apparently tried to prove

296
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,500
the glue wasn't that strong.

297
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,779
By gluing a red solo cup to his lip.

298
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:21,139
Around February 16th.

299
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,639
Yes, and predictably he ended up in the ER

300
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:24,740
because he couldn't get it off.

301
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:26,700
He was quoted saying something like,

302
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,399
this is definitely not one to try,

303
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,759
under statement of the year.

304
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,860
And the reaction was way less sympathetic than for Tessica.

305
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,100
Mostly just comments about stupidity.

306
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,519
Pretty much.

307
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,440
And then there was Avani Reyes,

308
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,360
another TikToker who also claims

309
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,080
she put gorilla glue in her hair.

310
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,519
Showed videos struggling to comb it,

311
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:45,320
even one from a hospital waiting room

312
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,620
saying her scalp was burning.

313
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:48,259
But a story got murky, didn't it?

314
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:50,000
People accused her of doing it for clout,

315
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:51,840
wasting hospital time during COVID.

316
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,980
Exactly, and her GoFundMe situation

317
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,000
was really confusing.

318
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,379
There were reports of donations,

319
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,379
even a big $3,000 one.

320
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,840
But then she apparently claimed the GoFundMe

321
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,620
was just a prank.

322
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,360
The big donation wasn't real

323
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,759
and insisted she wasn't a scammer.

324
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:07,000
So based on the sources,

325
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,879
it's kind of hard to tell if her situation was even real

326
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,639
or just an attempt to ride the viral wave.

327
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,240
Which is a whole other cautionary tale

328
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,279
about online content.

329
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:16,799
Definitely.

330
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,080
These cases, real or maybe staged,

331
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,879
just show how powerful and potentially harmful

332
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:23,059
these viral trends can be,

333
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:24,519
sparking dangerous imitations.

334
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,200
And it wasn't just imitations,

335
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,100
there were also people trying to actively debunk

336
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,519
Tessica's original story.

337
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,240
Like that YouTuber, December Reed, on February 10th.

338
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:36,159
Right, they sprayed the glue on hair extensions,

339
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:38,620
let it dry, used Goof Off,

340
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,980
and claimed it came right out, didn't really soak in.

341
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,379
But the comments section pushed back hard on that, right?

342
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,980
People argued maybe the glue needed water

343
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,620
to activate properly, or it needed way longer,

344
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:51,679
like 24 hours, or Tessica's whole month,

345
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,879
or maybe blow-drying it changed things.

346
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:55,220
Yeah, lots of counterarguments.

347
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,299
So even with videos trying to show it wasn't that bad,

348
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,799
a lot of people still seemed convinced

349
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:00,759
Tessica's story might have been faked anyway.

350
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,779
It just shows how sticky a narrative can be online.

351
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,080
Once people believe something,

352
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:08,580
it's hard to shake, even with counter-evidence.

353
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,899
It might help, though,

354
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:11,759
to quickly touch on hair glue in general,

355
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:13,620
because using some kind of glue

356
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,080
isn't totally unheard of professionally.

357
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,019
Good point.

358
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,500
Like, medical-grade adhesives are used

359
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,240
for weaves, wigs, extensions sometimes?

360
00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:22,659
Yeah, there are different methods.

361
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:26,259
Strand by strand, which takes ages, like six to eight hours,

362
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:29,139
or using wefted panels, which is faster.

363
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:30,840
And even those proper hair glues

364
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,419
can sometimes slip or fail, right?

365
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,500
Like if you sweat a lot or use oily products.

366
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,320
Correct, but, and this is the crucial point,

367
00:12:37,419 --> 00:12:38,559
the sources are crystal clear,

368
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,759
gorilla glue, the industrial stuff,

369
00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:43,559
absolutely not something used for hair, ever.

370
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,519
So circling back to Tessica's initial mistake,

371
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,039
while it doesn't excuse using it,

372
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:50,500
you can maybe see a sliver

373
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,940
of how the confusion could happen.

374
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,820
The spray bottle looks like hairspray.

375
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,980
There's that gorilla snot stuff for edges.

376
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,659
Her usual product was got-to-be glued.

377
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,399
It's a confluence of, like,

378
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,519
visual and name similarities.

379
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,460
It doesn't make it right,

380
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,379
but maybe explains the initial split-second grab

381
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:07,799
for the wrong can in a moment

382
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:09,039
of running out of her usual stuff.

383
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:09,720
Maybe?

384
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,460
Maybe.

385
00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:13,340
But ultimately, the big, loud takeaway

386
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,860
from all the sources is just

387
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,360
read the warning labels,

388
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,779
double-check what you're putting on your body,

389
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:19,259
sounds basic,

390
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:21,360
but this whole saga shows

391
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,399
the potentially severe consequences

392
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:24,940
when that step gets skipped.

393
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,820
A very public, very painful lesson learned there.

394
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,120
Okay, so we've covered the mistake,

395
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,080
the virality, the medical drama,

396
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,879
the copycats, the context,

397
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,019
but here's where the story takes

398
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:38,000
just an absolutely mind-bending turn.

399
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:39,059
Something that happened

400
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:41,360
after the glue nightmare was mostly over.

401
00:13:41,539 --> 00:13:42,940
Right, this part is,

402
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:45,379
well, it feels almost unbelievable,

403
00:13:45,379 --> 00:13:46,659
just the timing of it all.

404
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:48,700
So after the glue situation was resolved,

405
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,039
Tessago was planning a totally separate thing,

406
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:52,120
a mommy makeover.

407
00:13:52,659 --> 00:13:54,080
Reports on February 27th

408
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,580
mentioned breast lift implants.

409
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,720
And guess who her pre-surgery consultant

410
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,919
was for this procedure?

411
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,179
Dr. Michael Obang,

412
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:02,179
the same surgeon who freed her hair

413
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:03,059
just weeks earlier.

414
00:14:03,139 --> 00:14:04,500
Exactly, and here's the twist.

415
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,580
During the routine physical exam

416
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,440
for the breast surgery,

417
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,840
just earlier that week,

418
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,700
Dr. Obang found a lump...

419
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:10,919
Yeah.

420
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:12,179
...in each breast.

421
00:14:12,379 --> 00:14:13,779
Wow, just didn't, wow.

422
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:14,700
A chance finding

423
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,299
during an unrelated consultation.

424
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:18,120
A mammogram then confirmed

425
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,039
there were masses.

426
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:21,000
And the sources say

427
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,580
she's already had surgery to remove them

428
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,940
and they were being tested for cancer

429
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,899
at the time of reporting.

430
00:14:25,179 --> 00:14:26,480
That's genuinely astonishing.

431
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:27,720
A terrible mistake

432
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,559
leads her to a specific doctor

433
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:30,860
who, weeks later,

434
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,559
in a completely different context,

435
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,200
makes a potentially life-saving discovery.

436
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,000
It's incredible.

437
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:37,600
Tessago herself has quoted

438
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,919
saying she felt like the whole

439
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:39,960
gorilla glue thing

440
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,440
was somehow supposed to lead to this moment.

441
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,539
And you can imagine how that resonated online.

442
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,299
The public reaction to this news

443
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:47,539
was totally different.

444
00:14:47,539 --> 00:14:49,179
Just aw, really, people saying

445
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,580
everything happens for a reason.

446
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,860
The glue fiasco saved her.

447
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,399
Crazy how the universe works.

448
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:54,720
God is looking after her.

449
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,600
Yeah, it completely reframed the narrative,

450
00:14:56,659 --> 00:14:57,100
didn't it?

451
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,159
From a bizarre mistake

452
00:14:58,159 --> 00:14:59,879
to something...

453
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:00,899
maybe profound.

454
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:01,740
It really did.

455
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:03,120
So stepping back,

456
00:15:03,379 --> 00:15:04,539
what does this all really mean?

457
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:06,899
We dove into this story

458
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:08,200
that started as, you know,

459
00:15:08,299 --> 00:15:09,759
a shocking but seemingly

460
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:11,039
simple mistake on TikTok.

461
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:13,139
It blew up into internet fame,

462
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:14,259
caused real pain,

463
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:15,740
sparked huge debates,

464
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:16,720
needed surgery,

465
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,340
even inspired copycats.

466
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:20,039
It really is a microcosm

467
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:21,240
of our digital age, isn't it?

468
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,659
How fast personal stuff

469
00:15:22,659 --> 00:15:24,179
gets broadcast, judged,

470
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:25,779
amplified, copied,

471
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,120
generating both incredible support

472
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,600
and waves of criticism

473
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,799
and just plain bad information.

474
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:36,179
And then the truly wild part.

475
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:36,580
Yeah.

476
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:37,779
The sources show

477
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:39,320
how this viral mess

478
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,620
potentially led directly

479
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,019
to a critical,

480
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:43,960
maybe life-saving medical find.

481
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,279
It just highlights

482
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,639
the completely unpredictable

483
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:47,919
ways life can unfold.

484
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,539
How unforeseen events,

485
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:50,600
even negative ones,

486
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:51,960
can have these profound

487
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,419
unexpected consequences.

488
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,299
The whole journey

489
00:15:54,299 --> 00:15:55,659
just brings up so many questions,

490
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,100
doesn't it,

491
00:15:56,139 --> 00:15:57,740
about like information literacy,

492
00:15:58,059 --> 00:15:58,679
critical thinking

493
00:15:58,679 --> 00:15:59,840
when everything's going viral,

494
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,940
the sheer power of social media

495
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,100
for both good and bad

496
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,320
and just the strange,

497
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,840
complex ways people react

498
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,279
and cope.

499
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:06,779
Absolutely.

500
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:09,080
So looking at this whole rollercoaster,

501
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:09,799
here's something maybe

502
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:10,500
for you, the listener,

503
00:16:10,539 --> 00:16:11,080
to think about.

504
00:16:11,299 --> 00:16:11,960
In our world,

505
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,139
where stories like Tesicas

506
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,100
can explode overnight,

507
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,320
do you think they ultimately

508
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,279
make us more skeptical,

509
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,399
more critical of the stuff

510
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:18,000
we see online?

511
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:19,039
Or do they just end up

512
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:19,899
encouraging more people

513
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:21,220
to chase that viral fame

514
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,460
no matter what the risk might be?

515
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:22,960
Yeah.

516
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:24,220
That's a heavy question.

517
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,840
Definitely something to ponder

518
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,960
next time you're scrolling.

519
00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:28,399
Thanks for joining us

520
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,240
for this deep dive.
