1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,639
There are few scenarios more terrifying than being buried alive. It's the stuff of nightmares,

2
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:15,439
horror films, and Gothic fiction. But in December 1968, for one young woman from Florida,

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:23,640
that fear became a grueling and all-terreal experience. Barbara Jane Mackle, a 20-year-old

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:31,079
university student and heiress to a multi-million dollar fortune, was kidnapped at gunpoint and

5
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:38,799
left in a purpose-built box beneath the Georgia Soul. Remarkably, she survived her story,

6
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,259
one of calm resilience under unthinkable circumstances, remains one of the most bizarre

7
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:52,939
and chilling kidnappings in American criminal history. A heiress in peril, Barbara Mackle was,

8
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:59,899
by all accounts, living a comfortable and privileged life. The daughter of Robert Mackle,

9
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:07,439
a prominent Florida property developer and head of Deltona Corporation, Barbara had wealth,

10
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:14,560
status, and a promising future. The Mackle family were closed to political power, too.

11
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:23,480
Family friends included Senator George Smathers and even President-elect Richard Nixon. Barbara

12
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:30,579
was studying at Emory University in Atlanta when the Hong Kong flu swept through campus in

13
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:39,959
December 1968, feeling increasingly unwell. She left an exam early and called her mother Jane

14
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:45,900
to collect her so she could return home to Coral Gables for the Christmas break.

15
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:55,359
They checked into room 137 at a nearby motel, the roadway inn. Planning to leave for Florida

16
00:01:55,359 --> 00:02:02,920
the next day, the 4 a.m. knock. What happened in the early hours of the 17th of December reads

17
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:09,060
like the beginning of a crime thriller. At around 4 a.m. there was a knock at the door,

18
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:15,680
a man claiming to be a detective said there had been a traffic accident involving a white Ford.

19
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:21,800
The same type of car driven by Barbara's boyfriend, Stuart Woodward,

20
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:27,659
who had visited them earlier that evening, alarm, Jane opened the door.

21
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:34,400
Instead of a detective, two masked individuals forced their way inside.

22
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:42,840
One was tall and carried a shotgun. The other, shorter and slighter, appeared to be a teenage

23
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:51,439
ball, later revealed to be a woman in disguise. The taller intruder, Gary Stephen Christ,

24
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:57,759
used chloroform to subdue Jane while the accomplice, Ruth Iceman Shear,

25
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:05,400
bound her hands and feet. Barbara was taken at gunpoint and forced into their waiting car.

26
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:14,620
Jane Mackle regained consciousness quickly and alerted the police. But by then Barbara was being

27
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:22,580
transported north away from Atlanta and into the Georgia countryside. A box beneath the earth,

28
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:29,039
the kidnappers drove Barbara to a secluded pine grove in Gwinnett County, Georgia,

29
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:35,759
where they had prepared a coffin-like box to imprison her. It was no ordinary box.

30
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:43,219
It had been reinforced with fiberglass and fitted with air pipes to battery power lamp,

31
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:51,479
a supply of water laced with sedatives and food. It even included a fan to circulate air,

32
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:59,560
the attention to detail was chilling. Barbara was sedated and locked inside before Christ,

33
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:06,879
and Iceman Shear buried the box beneath 45 centimeters around a foot and a half of earth.

34
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:14,860
Inside she found this message. Do not be alarmed. You are safe. You are presently inside a

35
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:21,120
fiberglass reinforced plywood capsule buried beneath the ground near the house in which

36
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,160
your kidnappers are staying. Your status will be checked approximately every two hours.

37
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:34,620
The capsule is quite strong. You will not be able to break it open. Be advised, however,

38
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:41,319
that you are beneath the water table. If you break open a scene you would drown before we could

39
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:47,279
dig you out, the capsule instrumentation contains a water sensitive switch which will

40
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:54,620
warn us if the water enters the capsule to a dangerous degree. Your life depends on the air

41
00:04:54,620 --> 00:05:01,759
delivered to your chamber via the ventilation fan. This fan is powered by elite acid storage

42
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:10,300
battery capable of supplying the fan motor with power for 270 hours. However, the use of the

43
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:17,060
light and other systems for only a few hours coupled with the higher amperage drain will reduce

44
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:23,500
this figure to only one week of safety. Should the air supplied prove to be too much,

45
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:29,860
you can partly block the air outlet with a piece of paper. A muffler has been placed in the air

46
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:36,680
passage to prevent any noise you make from reaching the surface. If we detect any

47
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:43,800
commotion which we feel is dangerous, we will introduce ether to the air intake and put you to

48
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:51,519
sleep. The fan operates on six volts. IT has a switch with two positions to switch between the

49
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:58,279
two available circuits. Should one circuit fail, turn to the other. The box has a pump which

50
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:05,420
will evacuate any accidental leakage from the box when you turn the pump switch on to the

51
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:15,959
on position. This pump uses 15 times as much power as your ventilation fan 7.5 amps. Your life support

52
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:24,220
battery will not allow use of the pump except for emergency water evacuation. The light uses two

53
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:31,560
five times the average of the air circulation system. Use of the light when not necessary

54
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:37,600
will cut your battery safety margins substantially. If you use the light continuously,

55
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:45,079
your life expectancy will be cut to one third of the week. You have allotted you before you are

56
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:51,680
released. Your capsule contains a water jug with three gallons of water and a tube from

57
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,360
which to drink IT. Be careful to blow the water from the tube when you are finished

58
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:04,720
drinking to avoid siphoning the water onto the floor when the tube end drops below the water level.

59
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,920
Your capsule contains a bucket for refuse and the products of your bowel movements. The bucket

60
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:20,339
has an antibacterial solution in IT. Don't tip IT over. The lid seals tightly to prevent

61
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:28,720
the escape of odors. A roll of wax paper is provided. Use it to prevent solid waste from

62
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:37,540
contaminating your bed. Kotex is provided should you need IT. Lancettes and a mat are provided.

63
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:44,699
Your warmth depends on body heat so regulate the air to prevent loss of heat from the capsule.

64
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:53,220
A case of candy is provided to furnish energy to your body. Tranquilizers are provided to aid you

65
00:07:53,220 --> 00:08:00,959
in sleeping. The best way you have to pass the time. The ventilation system is doubly screened

66
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:07,819
to prevent insects or animals from entering the capsule area. You risk being eaten by ants

67
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:14,399
should you break these protection screens. The electrical components behind these screens

68
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:21,699
are delicate and they support your life. Don't attempt to touch these circuits. We're sure your

69
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:29,100
father will pay the ransom we have asked and last in one week. When your father pays the ransom

70
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:35,740
we will tell him where you are and he'll come for you. Should he fail to pay we will release you.

71
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:41,940
So be calm and rest. You'll be home for Christmas one way or the other.

72
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:50,059
She remained buried alive for more than 80 hours. Barbara later wrote about her ordeal in her memoir

73
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:58,799
83 hours till dawn where she described the moment the box was sealed and the dirt began to pile up.

74
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:06,820
I screamed and screamed the sound of the dirt got farther and farther away. Finally I couldn't

75
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:14,940
hear anything above. I screamed for a long time after that with no way to track the passage of time.

76
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:21,679
She survived by focusing on the image of spending Christmas morning with her family, the ransom

77
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:32,019
and FBI manhunt. Barbara's father, Robert Mackle, received a ransom demand for $500, zero.

78
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:40,299
The equivalent of around for $0.3 million in today's money. He agreed without hesitation

79
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:47,139
a first attempt had a ransom drop fail when two policemen happened to drive by causing the

80
00:09:47,139 --> 00:09:54,659
kidnappers to flee, abandoning their car in the process. Inside that car were several crucial

81
00:09:54,659 --> 00:10:03,139
clues, photographs, chloroform and documents pointing to a man named George D. Deacon who

82
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:10,139
worked at the University of Miami's Marine Science Department. He had experience constructing

83
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:18,580
ventilated boxes which raised red flags with the FBI. Further investigation revealed that

84
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:27,240
Deacon didn't exist. He was an alias being used by Gary Stephen Christ, a 23-year-old who had

85
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:35,039
escaped from a California prison in 1966. The ransom was successfully delivered on the second

86
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:44,179
attempt. Soon after, Christ made a call to the FBI giving vague directions to Barbara's location.

87
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:51,639
More than 100 FBI agents descended on the pine forest near Lawrenceville, Georgia.

88
00:10:52,259 --> 00:11:00,799
Using only the cryptic clues provided, they scoured the area with shovels, tools and their bare hands.

89
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:07,259
Finally, on the 20th of December, after three and a half days underground,

90
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:15,980
Barbara was found alive. She was dehydrated but in surprisingly good condition. Her ability to

91
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:24,940
remain calm and mentally focused was later described as extraordinary. After math and arrests, Barbara

92
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:32,580
was taken home to Florida where she celebrated Christmas with her family just as she had in

93
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:40,039
vision while trapped underground. Publicly, she seemed to recover well, though she made

94
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:47,740
few appearances in the media in the years following. Meanwhile, the FBI intensified their

95
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:55,060
search for the kidnappers. Christ was captured just days later. Sailing a speedboat off the

96
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:03,299
coast of Florida, bought using part of the ransom money, Iceman Shear was caught months later in

97
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:10,480
Oklahoma after her fingerprints matched those on file when she applied for a job at a hospital.

98
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:19,720
Christ was sentenced to life in prison in 1969 that served only 10 years before being paroled

99
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:27,259
in an astonishing twist. He later received a pardon that allowed him to attend medical school.

100
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:35,460
He became a licensed physician in Indiana. Both this to ended in scandal. His medical license

101
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:43,039
was revoked in 2003 after it emerged. He had lied about disciplinary actions during his

102
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:52,379
residency. Christ's post-prison career continued to raise eyebrows. In 2006, he was arrested aboard

103
00:12:52,379 --> 00:13:00,659
a sailboat off the coast of Alabama with 14 kilograms of cocaine and several undocumented

104
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:09,679
immigrants. He was sentenced to over five years in prison then in 2012. He violated the terms

105
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:18,299
of his probation by leaving the United States without permission sailing to Cuba and South America.

106
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:25,860
His supervised release was revoked and he was sentenced to a further 40 months as for Ruth

107
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:32,860
Iceman Shear. She was sentenced to seven years in prison but was paroled after for a

108
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:40,919
deport to her native Honduras. She remains the first woman ever to appear on the FBI's most

109
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:48,580
wanted list. A quiet life after trauma, Barbara Mackle rarely spoke publicly about the kidnapping

110
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:58,460
after her book was released in 1971. She moved back to Atlanta, married and raised a family.

111
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:06,759
Those who knew her described her as remarkably composed and private. A young woman who had endured

112
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:14,720
one of the most harrowing experiences imaginable and moved forward without fanfare. The box she

113
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:22,059
was buried and was later displayed by the FBI at lectures on criminal psychology and kidnapping

114
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:30,000
techniques. It became a macabre symbol of criminal ingenuity and the Barbaras will to live.
