Welcome to the Deep Dive, where we take your sources and extract the essential insights.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,740
We act as your guides, navigating the information and finding those surprising

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,599
facts and critical connections you might otherwise miss.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,320
Today's Deep Dive is based on a really candid conversation you shared with us,

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:21,239
excerpts from Katherine Pays' recent long-form interview on the Call Her Daddy YouTube channel.

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,420
Yeah, the source gives a pretty unique look behind the scenes of, well,

7
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:29,219
one of the most talked-about family vlogging channels, the Ace Family.

8
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:33,899
It really digs into its rise and eventual dissolution.

9
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,500
Right. Our mission today is to unpack the key points Katherine shared in this discussion,

10
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:43,179
finally shedding some light on some of the big questions that have surrounded them for so long.

11
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:46,299
You know, the relationship, their finances, all those controversies.

12
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:50,079
We're going to peel back the curtain on the rapid climb to fame and the very

13
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,280
personal struggles Katherine describes unfolding behind the scenes.

14
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:54,920
It's quite a journey she lays out.

15
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,659
Okay, let's unpack this. Katherine starts by sharing some

16
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,439
deeply personal details about her background. It really lays the foundation for who she became.

17
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,980
Yeah, she talks about her parents, immigrants from Nicaragua and Panama.

18
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:11,480
They met as teenagers, faced significant hardship.

19
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,879
She actually describes their relationship dynamic as quite toxic.

20
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:19,219
And what's striking is how she mentions her father being

21
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:21,560
a single dad for the first part of her childhood.

22
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,299
Exactly. And her mother making that really tough call to move to Florida,

23
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,579
believing it was for the family's best interests.

24
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:33,719
Katherine said even as a kid, she sort of understood her mom was doing the right thing.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And this early environment really shaped her perspective, especially around money.

26
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,379
She mentions here, and we don't have the money for that a lot.

27
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,920
Right. It created this powerful drive in her even from a young age.

28
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,799
She wanted to make a lot of money specifically to support her family, give them a distant life.

29
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,700
That financial stress, plus seeing her parents' difficult marriage.

30
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,000
How did that affect her view on relationships?

31
00:01:56,379 --> 00:02:00,079
Well, she says it profoundly impacted her. It led her to really desire this

32
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,359
traditional till death, do us part kind of marriage.

33
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,780
She desperately wanted her own kids to grow up with both parents there,

34
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,159
that stability she felt she missed out on.

35
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,159
Okay, so with that background, she moves to LA.

36
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,780
And that's where Austin McBroom comes into the picture.

37
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,740
Yep, met him at an all white party, very LA, as you said.

38
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,379
He messaged her later. She thinks it was Twitter or something like that.

39
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,219
And she describes his feeling she had almost immediately.

40
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:29,960
A really significant inner knowing, she called it.

41
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,900
The moment she met him, even on their first date, she felt this certainty.

42
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:37,099
She was going to marry him, have kids with him.

43
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,719
Wow, on the first date, that's fantastic.

44
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:41,919
And credibly fast first kiss saying, I love you, same day.

45
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,159
But she said she wasn't nervous about it at all.

46
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:46,360
It just felt meant to be.

47
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:48,939
Like they could skip the whole dating phase because they just knew.

48
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,240
What was it about him that drew her in?

49
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,319
She liked his confidence, apparently.

50
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,979
That he didn't seem to care what other people thought.

51
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,259
And she saw him as motivated, very free with himself.

52
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:02,919
Said it reminded her of her brother.

53
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,460
And the speed didn't slow down, pregnant pretty quickly.

54
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,020
About two months in, yeah.

55
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,580
And the way she told him, memorable.

56
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,659
Through the positive pregnancy test,

57
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,099
stick at him while he was on the bed.

58
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:14,919
Oh, okay.

59
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,699
And the Ace Family Channel itself, how did that start?

60
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:19,939
It wasn't some master plan.

61
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:20,699
No, not at all.

62
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,919
It was actually Austin's friend who suggested it.

63
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,020
They had posted some homemade videos online.

64
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,000
They went viral on Facebook and the friend was like,

65
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:29,419
hey, you could actually make money from this.

66
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,280
And the timing was interesting too, right?

67
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,919
With Austin's basketball career.

68
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,960
Yeah, perfect timing in a way.

69
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,180
His NBA dreams had sort of fizzled out that summer.

70
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,659
Basketball wasn't a clear path anymore.

71
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:44,259
So starting YouTube suddenly looked like a viable alternative.

72
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,560
So their first daughter, Elle, is born and putting her online.

73
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,340
How did they decide that?

74
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,879
Catherine says it just felt natural.

75
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:55,979
Their initial intentions, she insists,

76
00:03:56,419 --> 00:03:57,939
were pure just sharing their journey

77
00:03:57,939 --> 00:03:59,520
as this young family starting out.

78
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:01,860
No hesitation about putting the kids online back then.

79
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:02,740
Initially, no.

80
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:04,800
She felt like they were almost pioneering

81
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,120
that kind of family vlogging,

82
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:09,919
especially as social media was becoming this monster,

83
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:10,819
as she put it.

84
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:14,620
But then came the criticism, the accusations of exploiting the kids.

85
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:15,280
Right.

86
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,639
And she addresses that directly.

87
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,879
She maintains their initial intentions

88
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:21,959
were good in making a living while being present parents.

89
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:23,759
And it's fascinating, she points out

90
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,779
their most popular videos early on weren't the big stunts,

91
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:28,600
but just simple family moments,

92
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,180
like them sitting on the floor.

93
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:30,899
That's interesting.

94
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,300
And do they handle the kids' earnings responsibly?

95
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,660
She confirms they set up separate bank accounts

96
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,879
for the children very early, around 2017.

97
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:40,139
Elle was only about a year old then.

98
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,759
And looking back now, her perspective

99
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,199
on sharing kids online.

100
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:45,360
It's pretty nuanced.

101
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,540
She doesn't think there's a definite right or wrong.

102
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,560
Ultimately, she feels everything happens

103
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,660
the way it's meant to.

104
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,720
Kind of a fatalistic view, maybe.

105
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,879
Okay, let's shift to the financial side

106
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:55,939
of this massive success.

107
00:04:56,459 --> 00:04:57,759
They were making serious money.

108
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,740
Serious is an understatement.

109
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:01,360
She reveals at their peak,

110
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,379
they were pulling in seven figures.

111
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,560
A month.

112
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:05,319
A month.

113
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:05,720
Wow.

114
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,779
How did she even process that?

115
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,240
That's, I think she says she felt numb,

116
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,699
sort of disattached from it,

117
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:11,759
like it wasn't quite real.

118
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,319
And looking back now,

119
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,699
she expresses a lot of regret.

120
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,579
Bad business decisions, having yes men around.

121
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,540
Wishing she'd invested differently.

122
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,040
Helped your parents more.

123
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:21,620
Exactly.

124
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:25,279
It really highlights how getting that huge financial goal

125
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:27,399
didn't automatically equal happiness,

126
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,180
especially when it came from something

127
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,040
with so much pressure attached.

128
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,720
And that pressure changed how they approached content, right?

129
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:34,220
Definitely.

130
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,100
She describes this shift from filming parts of their life

131
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,259
to feeling like they were living to film.

132
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,740
Everything became about the next big reveal,

133
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,160
the clickbait surprise.

134
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,540
She used the phrase clown in a circus.

135
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,319
Yeah, feeling like she had to perform

136
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,980
these surprise reactions for the camera,

137
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,579
rather than just genuinely experiencing moments together.

138
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,259
Was there a specific moment she realized

139
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,680
how much strain this was causing?

140
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,800
She talks about her second daughter's birth,

141
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:00,800
feeling disconnected,

142
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:02,740
not really wanting to film it,

143
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,959
but feeling this obligation

144
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:05,240
because the audience was waiting.

145
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:08,139
It even made her question if Austin was truly present

146
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:09,980
or just focused on getting the shot.

147
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,639
And that bled into other things.

148
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:11,920
Yeah.

149
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,000
Like wondering if his romantic gestures were real

150
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,360
or just for show.

151
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,639
Were they genuine or for the camera?

152
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,399
And then feeling she had to give

153
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:23,560
this big theatrical reaction back.

154
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,839
She admits they just didn't communicate

155
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:28,240
about boundaries, about what should stay private.

156
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,660
This lack of partnership seems to have extended to money, too.

157
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:33,160
According to her, yes.

158
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,259
Big time.

159
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:37,800
She describes Austin making huge financial decisions,

160
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,220
six figures sometimes disappearing from accounts

161
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,699
without even talking to her about it.

162
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,300
Like what kind of decisions?

163
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,819
Paying for private jets, things like that,

164
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,139
stuff she says she wouldn't have chosen herself,

165
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,959
things that weren't priorities for her before him.

166
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,339
That must have caused a lot of tension.

167
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:53,800
She says it was heartbreaking.

168
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,199
It caused immense stress in the relationship.

169
00:06:56,899 --> 00:06:58,399
How did he react when she brought it up?

170
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,319
Apparently often dismissive,

171
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,040
like, I'm sorry, I just didn't want you to worry.

172
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,040
But for her, marriage meant tackling these big issues together,

173
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,699
things affecting their kids, their future.

174
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,819
It wasn't just about shielding her.

175
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,720
Which brings us to the house foreclosure.

176
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:14,300
Very public, very symbolic.

177
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,740
Yeah, by then she felt like she was losing control

178
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,379
over everything, family, relationship, career.

179
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,399
The house was the one thing she was desperately trying

180
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,959
to hold onto as something stable.

181
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:24,980
And she found out.

182
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:25,899
How?

183
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,500
Completely out of the blue.

184
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,459
Her father-in-law called her,

185
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:31,959
Catherine, the house is under foreclosure.

186
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,160
It's all over the news.

187
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,699
Just like that.

188
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:36,339
But she thought she was paying the mortgage.

189
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:40,060
She said she was paying it every month for three years.

190
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:41,540
She was totally confused.

191
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:43,480
The reasons given were technical.

192
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,220
The loan type ended.

193
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,540
It was a jumbo loan, no certificate of occupancy.

194
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,800
But it didn't make sense to her.

195
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,420
The impact on her must have been immense.

196
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:53,339
Devastating.

197
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,100
She said she cried in ocean.

198
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:58,079
Losing the house broke her more than anything else.

199
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:00,959
It represented that feeling of home, of security

200
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:02,379
she'd been seeking her whole life.

201
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,639
Losing it felt like losing the last anchor.

202
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:07,180
And behind the scenes during all this chaos,

203
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:08,379
what was life like?

204
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,980
She describes feeling like she was constantly pretending,

205
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:14,259
deeply disconnected from herself in a really dark place,

206
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,220
barely going out, not seeing friends or family much.

207
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:18,160
And all the while,

208
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:21,180
these cheating rumors about Austin are swirling online.

209
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:25,360
Constantly, her initial reaction, her heart sank.

210
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,600
She even found herself wondering if he physically had the time to cheat,

211
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:33,059
remembering some saying about men always having time.

212
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:34,519
Did she see evidence herself?

213
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,379
She mentions getting random specific texts while he was right beside her.

214
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,519
It made it incredibly hard to know what was real and what wasn't.

215
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,960
So a mix of true, false, distorted information.

216
00:08:47,179 --> 00:08:49,659
Exactly, just creating total confusion for her.

217
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,860
And she says she did confront him about the allegations early on.

218
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,580
What was his response back then?

219
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,759
Basically that it comes with the territory of being famous,

220
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,139
that they shouldn't respond because it would just make it worse.

221
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:03,679
And she says at that point, she trusted him.

222
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,759
She followed his lead.

223
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,980
Did she believe he was cheating right from the very start of the rumors?

224
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,679
No, she actually says she doesn't think he was cheating

225
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:13,860
right at the beginning when those first allegations surfaced.

226
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,740
Okay, so when did that shift happen?

227
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,679
When did suspicion turn into knowing?

228
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:19,820
She pinpoints a key moment.

229
00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:22,539
The, oh shit, he's cheating realization.

230
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:26,299
It was after Austin went to Miami for a supposed meeting.

231
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,860
Their second daughter was only about six months old.

232
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,120
Did she question him going?

233
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:30,899
Not really.

234
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,419
She mentions her personality is usually trusting, giving partners freedom,

235
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:37,980
which she notes really contrasted with her mom's reaction,

236
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:40,860
who was like, why are you letting him go with such a young baby?

237
00:09:41,179 --> 00:09:42,460
What happened while he was in Miami?

238
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:44,740
He accidentally pocket dialed her.

239
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:46,799
She heard women's voices in the background.

240
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,419
At the time, she kind of brushed it off like, okay,

241
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,379
I guess he's hanging out with women and hung up.

242
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:52,980
Didn't seem like a huge deal then.

243
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,279
But then something else came up later.

244
00:09:55,419 --> 00:09:56,159
Months later, yeah.

245
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,500
A blonde male makeup artist posted a YouTube video,

246
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:03,480
and it had specific details about Austin, other women,

247
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,879
and a boat trip that same weekend in Miami.

248
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:10,639
And Catherine saw this video while she was secretly pregnant with their son.

249
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,100
Oh, wow.

250
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,220
How did she react to seeing that video?

251
00:10:13,419 --> 00:10:14,220
Total breakdown.

252
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:16,039
Balling her eyes out, she said.

253
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,960
Questioning everything, was it true?

254
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,159
Was she being stupid?

255
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:21,720
Should she just try to keep the peace for the family?

256
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,940
She did confront Austin about that video.

257
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,740
And his reaction.

258
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:25,440
Denial.

259
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,879
Claim the guy was trying to extort him.

260
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:32,500
But Catherine says, deep down, she knew something was really wrong.

261
00:10:32,659 --> 00:10:35,179
She just actively lied to herself, she was pregnant,

262
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,100
wanted to protect that little piece of peace they had left.

263
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,000
She also mentioned a dream around this time.

264
00:10:40,059 --> 00:10:40,940
Yeah, really vivid.

265
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,559
A beautiful blonde woman turning into a demon on her bed,

266
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,779
woke up crying, felt eerie all day.

267
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:48,940
Very symbolic, right?

268
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,320
Definitely.

269
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,399
And that same day, something else happened, something concrete.

270
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:53,779
Yes.

271
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:56,840
They were filming for Vlogmas, at a salon,

272
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,460
getting their daughter's first haircut,

273
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,059
fans around, cameras rolling, the whole setup.

274
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:02,440
Her phone died.

275
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:05,220
She asked to use Austin's phone just to take a picture.

276
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:09,139
And she stresses she had never looked in his phone before, ever.

277
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:09,759
And then what?

278
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,200
The second she grabbed it,

279
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:14,360
a long text message popped right up on the screen from a woman.

280
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,860
And the content, what she quickly saw,

281
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,220
clearly implied an emotional relationship,

282
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,620
something like, if you really loved your wife.

283
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,019
Oh my god, in that moment.

284
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,100
Her heart just dropped, felt totally surreal,

285
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:26,399
like she wasn't on earth anymore.

286
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:29,539
And she's pregnant, people are watching, the cameras on her.

287
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:30,500
Did anyone else see it?

288
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:31,659
Their assistant saw it too.

289
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,659
Austin immediately grabbed the phone back

290
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:35,460
and deleted the message right there.

291
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,519
And for Catherine, that was it.

292
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,379
Oh my gosh, it's true, no more doubt.

293
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,679
How did she handle that, right then and there?

294
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:45,899
Somehow she kept calm, finished filming at the salon.

295
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:49,440
But in the car on the way home, she confronted him quietly

296
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,600
because the kids were there.

297
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:53,340
He was just evasive, it's nothing.

298
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,059
Look back home.

299
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,379
Full breakdown, yelling, screaming, begging him for the truth.

300
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,740
Feeling so stupid, she said,

301
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,779
because she'd been pregnant and ignoring her gut feeling for so long.

302
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,539
What did she do?

303
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,879
Ran out of the house, just drove around crying aimlessly,

304
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:10,919
ended up parking at a park, just praying,

305
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:13,440
God, if you hear me, please tell me what to do.

306
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,080
Did you feel like she got an answer?

307
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,240
She describes hearing this clear voice,

308
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,720
telling her to be strong for her son,

309
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:21,940
steal a name she already knew she'd use.

310
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,519
The voice told her not to make impulsive decisions,

311
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,080
just keep going, it would all make sense later.

312
00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:28,240
So she went back home.

313
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,120
Yeah, decided to just act like nothing for a couple of days.

314
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:35,700
She said it was the longest they'd ever gone

315
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,000
without speaking since they met.

316
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,220
And after those couple of days, did they talk?

317
00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:41,799
Yes, in the car again.

318
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,639
He finally told her who the woman from the text message was.

319
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:47,320
Did they clarify things?

320
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,879
It made things all make sense, she said.

321
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:52,700
She remembered him previously mentioning

322
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,279
helping some woman with Snapchat,

323
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,279
and it all clicked into place.

324
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:58,600
The lies, the denials.

325
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:01,120
And her reaction then, after he admitted it.

326
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,259
Surprisingly, maybe her first instinct was still forgiveness.

327
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:06,539
She felt he was maybe crying out for help.

328
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,019
That traditional view of marriage sticking by her husband

329
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:11,440
was still really strong.

330
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:13,220
Was this round the time they went to Hawaii?

331
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,460
Yeah, that trip was suggested for healing,

332
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,559
supposedly because Hawaii is the heart chakra of the planet,

333
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,440
a spiritual attempt to fix things.

334
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:22,179
And she announced her pregnancy from there.

335
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:22,860
She did.

336
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,139
She felt like she was carrying this huge secret

337
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:26,700
about the marriage falling apart

338
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,980
and just wanted to scream the truth but couldn't.

339
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,080
Announcing the pregnancy felt like

340
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,779
the only thing she could share publicly.

341
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,039
Looking back, she realized her focus was always on fixing it.

342
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,159
Always, how can we fix this?

343
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:42,620
Like it was a business problem, not this deep emotional betrayal.

344
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,019
She was so focused on trying to stay by him,

345
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,679
she wasn't really letting herself feel her own pain.

346
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,360
And Austin's reaction during all this, was he apologetic?

347
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,179
She says it never felt genuinely apologetic to her.

348
00:13:55,539 --> 00:13:56,360
Not really.

349
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,480
And get this, she says he never actually uttered the words

350
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,639
I cheated to her until literally about a week before

351
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,379
this Call Her Daddy interview came out.

352
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:04,779
Wow.

353
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,679
Only when her book chapter detailing it was published.

354
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,379
Exactly.

355
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:11,200
She said finally hearing him say it, admit it,

356
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:12,440
was actually healing for her.

357
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:13,360
It was validation.

358
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,980
Proof she wasn't crazy after all those denials.

359
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,740
Why do you think he finally admitted it then, publicly?

360
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,639
She speculates maybe because the book called him out directly

361
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:24,440
or maybe he finally understood the bigger picture,

362
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,179
the consequences.

363
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:28,220
She also pushes back hard on something he claimed recently.

364
00:14:28,419 --> 00:14:28,779
Oh yeah.

365
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:31,399
His claim in a video that she was basically

366
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,940
okay with it as long as you don't embarrass me.

367
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:37,580
She says that is absolutely not true and deeply hurtful.

368
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:40,559
Because it shifts the blame, avoids accountability.

369
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:41,759
Precisely.

370
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:45,340
She emphasizes she would never say that and it's not what she

371
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,559
teach her kids about relationships or cheating.

372
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:51,399
Did she confirm other affairs besides the one link to the text?

373
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:51,879
Yes.

374
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,220
She confirmed knowing about multiple women.

375
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,700
She specifically said she's for sure aware of three.

376
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,179
Okay.

377
00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:00,779
And what about some of those really specific viral rumors

378
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:03,179
that Tana Mojo lipstick story?

379
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,639
Catherine believes Kanna's account is true

380
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:10,820
and she feels Tana covering for him basically confirmed it for her back then.

381
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:12,100
She was hurt.

382
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,960
Tana didn't tell her directly though.

383
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,440
The rumor about hiring nannies to sleep with.

384
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,899
False she says.

385
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:19,440
They never even had a nanny.

386
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:21,559
The yacht orgy rumor in Miami.

387
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:25,000
That one she says she got confirmation about years later

388
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,240
through a friend whose husband was actually there on the yacht that weekend.

389
00:15:28,419 --> 00:15:28,620
Whoa.

390
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:31,840
And bringing his mistress to their own charity event at the Staple Center.

391
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,259
She confirms that's true.

392
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:36,139
Says it was the same woman from the text message incident.

393
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:37,879
A huge public betrayal.

394
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,480
Austin denied that one publicly, right?

395
00:15:39,659 --> 00:15:40,159
He did.

396
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:43,340
Catherine sees that as him just trying to control the narrative

397
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:46,659
because it makes him look terrible doing that at a family event they were hosting.

398
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:48,980
But she insists it absolutely happened.

399
00:15:49,419 --> 00:15:52,899
A family member of his even confirmed telling him not to bring that girl.

400
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:56,639
It was a big moment for her confirming the extent of the lies.

401
00:15:57,179 --> 00:15:58,740
So with all this going on,

402
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,940
what happened to their intimacy, their sex life?

403
00:16:03,259 --> 00:16:05,679
She explains that once she knew about the cheating,

404
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,879
she just checked out emotionally and physically.

405
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:10,639
She felt her body was a temple

406
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,919
and refused intimacy when there was no honesty between them.

407
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,799
For how long?

408
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,259
Essentially no intimacy for maybe four or five years.

409
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,519
Spanning postpartum periods, the allegations, pregnancies.

410
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:22,919
A long time.

411
00:16:23,059 --> 00:16:25,340
Did she take any responsibility for that lack of intimacy?

412
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:25,860
She does.

413
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,940
She takes full accountability for not having serious talks about it

414
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,960
or seeking therapy together to address it.

415
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,759
But ultimately, the cheating was the final straw.

416
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:34,480
Absolutely.

417
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,059
She says that was the breaking point.

418
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:38,340
The marriage couldn't survive that level of betrayal.

419
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:42,700
And Austin's bizarre claim about her thinking she was the virgin Mary

420
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,220
reincarnated as the reason for no sex.

421
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,960
Yeah, she addressed that, calls it really hurtful,

422
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:50,860
and just the strange thing to say.

423
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,799
She sees it as him just throwing jabs,

424
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,340
trying to make her look crazy by twisting her spirituality,

425
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,220
her connection to Christ and Mother Mary,

426
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,399
into something weird or delusional.

427
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,860
Why did she keep all this secret for so long?

428
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,559
Not confide in anyone.

429
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,799
Several reasons.

430
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,940
She didn't want to change how people saw Austin initially.

431
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:13,099
She still held on to hope they could heal privately,

432
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,900
and she genuinely believes gossiping is poison.

433
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,880
So she didn't tell family until she decided on divorce.

434
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:19,400
Right.

435
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,720
Only told her parents and family when she knew for sure she wanted out.

436
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:26,019
But keeping it inside must have been incredibly difficult.

437
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,180
She admits it was eating her alive,

438
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,640
but eventually it felt like everybody knows anyway,

439
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,759
as things became more obvious publicly.

440
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,619
That pressure of keeping up appearances.

441
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,160
Huge impact on her,

442
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:37,940
feeling like she was in a fishbowl,

443
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,059
performing this happy family image

444
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,500
while living a completely different reality.

445
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,559
It sounds like a massive internal conflict.

446
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,460
Protect the image, the kid's stability.

447
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:46,799
Yeah.

448
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,220
Versus telling your truth.

449
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:48,920
Exactly.

450
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:51,519
Her priority was always being a mother first.

451
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:53,779
The thought of creating two homes,

452
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:57,400
figuring out a new livelihood, it was overwhelming.

453
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,359
Plus, being a content creator,

454
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,099
couple added another layer.

455
00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:03,339
And the hardest part was his denial to her.

456
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:06,279
Yeah, because if he wouldn't admit it to her privately,

457
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:07,559
he'd never admit it publicly.

458
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,440
She felt completely gaslighted,

459
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:11,319
knowing the truth but being told she was wrong.

460
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:13,039
She mentioned the public judgment too.

461
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,740
People just judge on the surface,

462
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:17,980
she said, without knowing the full story.

463
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,440
And another reason for silence.

464
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,539
Not wanting to hurt him or the fans.

465
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:22,960
Yeah.

466
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,880
She didn't want to break the family in that public way,

467
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,400
disappoint millions of fans.

468
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,960
And she didn't want to see Austin face that humiliation.

469
00:18:30,579 --> 00:18:32,240
She thought she could handle her own pain,

470
00:18:32,339 --> 00:18:33,819
but maybe not his public scrutiny.

471
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,839
Ironic because he got the scrutiny anyway

472
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:39,460
and she realized she had to stop living the lie for herself.

473
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:41,720
So the final, final breaking point.

474
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,460
When did she know, okay, this is it, I have to leave now.

475
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,920
She describes a conversation right before one of Austin's boxing matches.

476
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:51,059
She finally said, I'm not happy.

477
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:52,440
His response.

478
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:53,960
Dismissive.

479
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,460
Told her not to bring it up with the fight so close.

480
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,339
Then he got sick right before the fight.

481
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,420
Yeah, 103 fever.

482
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,180
She saw it as symbolic, a message like a mirror of their internal chaos.

483
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,619
What about the fight itself?

484
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,420
Watching him get knocked down repeatedly but keep getting up.

485
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,819
It gave her this thought, this is who he is,

486
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,039
he always stands up when he falls.

487
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:17,599
She felt she heard a voice say it was an ego death for him

488
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:19,680
and she needed to hold space for him.

489
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,119
So even then still feeling protective?

490
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:25,539
In a way, in the ambulance afterward he was disoriented.

491
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,799
The next day she posted that picture holding his hand.

492
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:30,799
She explained it wasn't romantic love

493
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,420
but showing she was still there for him as family as a team.

494
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,779
No matter what I will always stand by his side.

495
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:38,680
But that moment also clarified something else for her.

496
00:19:39,019 --> 00:19:41,900
Yes, it solidified she was okay being a family team

497
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,740
but they weren't really a team because the lies were still there.

498
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:45,900
He wasn't being honest.

499
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,359
When did the, it has to be 9W realization hit?

500
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:50,940
On her 33rd birthday.

501
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,579
A year she'd always felt would be significant.

502
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:58,000
That day she booked her flight for that spiritual retreat in Brazil.

503
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:01,039
That booking was the decision she says,

504
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,059
even if the words weren't spoken yet.

505
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,480
The separation felt inevitable in the air.

506
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,279
Okay, so the actual divorce conversation, when and how?

507
00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:12,079
Right when she got back from Brazil.

508
00:20:12,819 --> 00:20:16,599
She described the retreat as this massive expansive experience.

509
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,599
She got in the car with Austin at the airport.

510
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:19,759
And just told him.

511
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:20,339
Pretty directly.

512
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:23,819
It's not a secret that our relationship is done and we're both unhappy.

513
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:24,759
I want a divorce.

514
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,039
His reaction.

515
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:26,940
Okay.

516
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:28,859
She felt relief, even happiness.

517
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:31,220
Wanted to work on an exit plan together, keep it amicable.

518
00:20:32,019 --> 00:20:34,440
Interestingly, his realtor had just sent him a listing

519
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,740
for a rental house down the street.

520
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,180
He saw it as interesting how life works.

521
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,339
They didn't do a joint announcement video though.

522
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:40,799
Why not?

523
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:43,680
Catherine felt if he couldn't be truthful off camera,

524
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,940
he wouldn't be truthful on camera about the real reasons,

525
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,140
especially the cheating.

526
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,500
She was willing to own her mistakes,

527
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:53,119
but he wasn't ready to be honest about his infidelity.

528
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,059
So she suggested a written statement.

529
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:59,000
Yeah, but he wanted a video offered to show it to her first.

530
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,980
She waited a month.

531
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:04,900
When she finally saw it, she felt it was social suicide for him,

532
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,680
just going around the truth, not vulnerable at all.

533
00:21:08,259 --> 00:21:09,559
She told him she didn't like it.

534
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:11,700
And then something really disturbing happened.

535
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,740
She believes he secretly recorded her reaction

536
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,779
while she was watching that video and telling him she didn't like it.

537
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:19,940
You recorded her without consent?

538
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:20,400
Yes.

539
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,400
She feels he made the video knowing she wouldn't approve

540
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,160
and recorded her reaction purposefully, maybe to use later.

541
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,759
She calls it manipulative and illegal.

542
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:30,619
Wow.

543
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,279
Okay.

544
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,059
She also talked about using ayahuasca.

545
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:33,519
She did.

546
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,500
So she started during that really dark period,

547
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,539
marriage problems, losing the house, scams, all of it.

548
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,640
Was she doing it alone?

549
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,880
Her brother had used it for years and was supportive.

550
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,859
She described one ceremony leading to a full Kundalini awakening,

551
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,579
helping her remember things, changing her life.

552
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:51,900
She sees it as a very powerful tool.

553
00:21:52,059 --> 00:21:53,619
Austin made claims about that too, right?

554
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:54,859
About the kids being there.

555
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,319
Yes, he claimed the kids were home during ceremonies.

556
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,000
She calls that a lie, deeply hurtful,

557
00:22:01,339 --> 00:22:03,640
and another jab at something sacred to her.

558
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,500
Things people throw stones at things they don't understand.

559
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,400
Does she ever use it with Austin?

560
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,559
Or did others express concern?

561
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,359
No, never used it with him.

562
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:15,819
And she says no one close to her has ever expressed concern about her use.

563
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:18,859
And the weirdest claim that she turned him into a mermaid?

564
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:19,799
Huh, yeah.

565
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:21,160
She finds that funny now.

566
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:24,539
This explains it was just for a mermaid themed photo shoot

567
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:26,319
for her skincare line launch in Hawaii.

568
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:27,759
Just a fun shoot.

569
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,380
So why would he say that?

570
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:32,759
She thinks because people were making fun of the photos online already,

571
00:22:33,099 --> 00:22:35,980
he just jumped on it to extra painter look crazy.

572
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,920
Another attempt to discredit her.

573
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:40,759
So fast forward, she's moved on, new relationship.

574
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:44,339
Yes, met her new partner Igor on that same Rizzo retreat,

575
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,319
middle of the Amazon, she said.

576
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,019
And she's open about the timeline now.

577
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:48,460
Very.

578
00:22:48,819 --> 00:22:49,920
She owns it, she says.

579
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:53,980
Emphasizes her relationship with Austin was emotionally and intimately over

580
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,559
for years before she met Igor.

581
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,359
That's important context.

582
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,619
What was her mindset going into that retreat?

583
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,299
Was she looking for someone?

584
00:23:01,779 --> 00:23:02,460
Quite the opposite.

585
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:04,119
I felt she had too much baggage.

586
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,900
Three kids, public figure, thought she'd be alone forever,

587
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,059
wasn't looking to date.

588
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:13,839
But she'd reached a point of feeling complete and whole in herself.

589
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,359
Relationship or not.

590
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,359
And the retreat changed that perspective.

591
00:23:17,619 --> 00:23:19,240
Realized the baggage was all in my head.

592
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,160
Meeting Igor started is just friendship within that experience.

593
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,480
Never expected more.

594
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,680
How does she describe the new relationship?

595
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:30,220
Says she's never felt so safe, feels she really earned it

596
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,380
after everything she went through.

597
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,640
How do Austin and Igor get along?

598
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,039
Or seem to?

599
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,059
She can't speak for Austin's real feelings.

600
00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:42,380
But she notes his public gestures, like getting Igor a stepfather shirt.

601
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:43,660
Kind of hard to read.

602
00:23:44,019 --> 00:23:45,920
And has she met Austin's new partner?

603
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,799
Yes, about a year ago.

604
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,539
Says she likes her, trusts her kids, judgment and how they interact with her.

605
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,299
Doesn't judge their journey, basically.

606
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:54,000
Wow.

607
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,940
That is an incredible amount to process.

608
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:00,900
It really gives so much depth and context to a story that played out so publicly.

609
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,220
Yeah, from that dizzying rise to fame,

610
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,400
built on this image of a perfect family,

611
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:11,059
to the really profound struggles hidden underneath the finances, the infidelity.

612
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:14,960
It paints such a picture of that internal conflict she faced, right?

613
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:19,240
Trying to keep up the public image versus her private reality,

614
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,799
the tool it took on her sense of self.

615
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,299
Absolutely.

616
00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:24,599
And then her incredibly difficult path towards healing,

617
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:28,299
finding her own voice, and ultimately a new beginning.

618
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,960
Her final message in the interview was about forgiveness.

619
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:33,400
Yeah, just forgiveness is key.

620
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,660
Simple but powerful given everything she described.

621
00:24:36,859 --> 00:24:39,740
Her whole story just makes you think about the complexities, doesn't it?

622
00:24:39,819 --> 00:24:42,519
The potential cost of that kind of public life,

623
00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:47,339
how incredibly hard it must be to navigate trauma when everyone's watching.

624
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,000
And the strength it takes to break away from a situation,

625
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,779
even a painful one that feels familiar or safe.

626
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:57,400
It also shows how different people react, staying, leaving,

627
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,180
protecting the family image above all else.

628
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,099
It really leaves you with a potent thought to mull over, doesn't it?

629
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,119
In this age of constant sharing,

630
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,019
how does that pressure to maintain a perfect public image

631
00:25:08,019 --> 00:25:11,099
actually change how we experience and how we respond to

632
00:25:11,099 --> 00:25:13,940
our own private, often really messy, crises?
